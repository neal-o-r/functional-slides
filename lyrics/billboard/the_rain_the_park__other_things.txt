i saw her sitting in the rain raindrops falling on her she didnt seem to care she sat there and smiled at me then i knew she could make me happy flowers in her hair flowers everywhere i love the flower girl oh i dont know just why she simply caught my eye i love the flower girl she seemed so sweet and kind she crept into my mind to my mind i knew i had to say hello she smiled up at me and she took my hand and we walked through the park alone and i knew she had made me happy flowers in her hair flowers everywhere i love the flower girl oh i dont know just why she simply caught my eye i love the flower girl she seemed so sweet and kind she crept into my mind to my mind suddenly the sun broke through i turned around she was gone all i had left was one little flower in my hand but i knew she had made me happy flowers in her hair flowers everywhere i love the flower girl was she reality or just a dream to me i love the flower girl her love showed me the way to find a sunny day sunny day i love the flower girl was she reality or just a dream to me i love the flower girl

 i cant fight this feeling any longer and yet im still afraid to let it flow what started out as friendship has grown stronger i only wish i had the strength to let it showi tell myself that i cant hold out forever i said there is no reason for my fear cause i feel so secure when were together you give my life direction you make everything so clearand even as i wander im keeping you in sight youre a candle in the window on a cold dark winters night and im getting closer than i ever thought i mightand i cant fight this feeling anymore ive forgotten what i started fighting for its time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars forevercause i cant fight this feeling anymore ive forgotten what i started fighting for and if i have to crawl upon the floor come crashing through your door baby i cant fight this feeling anymoremy life has been such a whirlwind since i saw you ive been running round in circles in my mind and it always seems that im following you girl cause you take me to the places that alone id never findand even as i wander im keeping you in sight youre a candle in the window on a cold dark winters night and im getting closer than i ever thought i mightand i cant fight this feeling anymore ive forgotten what i started fighting for its time to bring this ship into the shore and throw away the oars forevercause i cant fight this feeling anymore ive forgotten what i started fighting for and if i have to crawl upon the floor come crashing through your door baby i cant fight this feeling anymore

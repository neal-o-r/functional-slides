 somewhere out there beneath the pale moon light someones thinking of me and loving me tonightsomewhere out there someones saying a prayer that well find one another in that big somewhere out thereand even though i know how very far apart we are it helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright starand when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby it helps to think were sleeping underneath the same big skysomewhere out there if love can see us through then well be together somewhere out there out where dreams come trueand even though i know how very far apart we are it helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright starand when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby it helps to think were sleeping underneath the same big skysomewhere out there if love can see us through then well be together somewhere out there out where dreams come true

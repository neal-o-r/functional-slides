 on a morning from a bogart movie in a country where they turn back time you go strolling through the crowd like peter lorre contemplating a crime she comes out of the sun in a silk dress running like a watercolor in the rain dont bother asking for explanations shell just tell you that she came in the year of the catshe doesnt give you time for questions as she locks up your arm in hers and you follow till your sense of which direction completely disappears by the blue tiled walls near the market stalls theres a hidden door she leads you to these days she says i feel my life just like a river running through the year of the catwhile she looks at you so cooly and her eyes shine like the moon in the sea she comes in incense and patchouli so you take her to find whats waiting inside the year of the catwell morning comes and youre still with her and the bus and the tourists are gone and youve thrown away your choice youve lost your ticket so you have to stay on but the drumbeat strains of the night remain in the rhythm of the newborn day you know sometime youre bound to leave her but for now youre going to stay in the year of the cat

remember when the days were long and rolled beneath a deep blue sky didnt have a care in the world with mommy and daddy standing by when happily ever after fails and weve been poisoned by these fairy tales the lawyers dwell on small details since daddy had to fly aah but i know a place where we can go thats still untouched by men well sit and watch the clouds roll by and the tall grass waves in the wind and you can lay your head back on the ground and let your hair fall all around me offer up your best defense but this is the end this is the end of the innocence oh beautiful for spacious skies but now those skies are threatening theyre beating plowshares into swords for this tired old man that we elected king armchair warriors often fail and weve been poisoned by these fairy tales the lawyers clean up all details since daddy had to lie aah but i know a place where we can go and wash away this sin well sit and watch the clouds roll by and the tall grass waves in the wind just lay your head back on the ground and let your hair spill all around me offer up your best defense but this is the end this is the end of the innocence who knows how long this will last now weve come so far so fast but somewhere back there in the dust that same small town in each of us i need to remember this so baby give me just one kiss and let me take a long last look before we say goodbye just lay your head back on the ground and let your hair fall all around me offer up your best defense this is the end this is the end of the innocence

 love is but the song we sing and fears the way we die you can make the mountains ring or make the angels cry know the dove is on the wing and you need not know why cmon people now smile on your brother evrybody get together try and love one another right now some will come and some will go we shall surely pass when the one that left us here returns for us at last we are but a moments sunlight fading in the grass cmon people now smile on your brother evrybody get together try and love one another right now if you hear the song i sing you must understand you hold the key to love and fear all in your trembling hand just one key unlocks them both its there at your command cmon people now smile on your brother evrybody get together try and love one another right now right now right now

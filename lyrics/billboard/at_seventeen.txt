 i learned the truth at seventeen that love was meant for the beauty queens and high school girls with clearskinned smiles who married young and then retiredthe valentines i never knew the friday night charades of youth were spent on one more beautiful at seventeen i learned the truthand those of us with ravaged faces lacking in the social graces desperately remained at home inventing lovers on the phonewho called to say come dance with me and murmured vague obscenities it isnt all it seems at seventeena browneyed girl in handmedowns whose name i never could pronounce said pity please the ones who serve they only get what they deserveand the rich relationed hometown queen marries into what she needs with a guarantee of company and haven for the elderlyremember those who win the game they lose the love they sought to gain in debentures of quality and dubious integritytheir small town eyes will gape at you in dull surprise when payment due exceeds accounts received at seventeento those of us who knew the pain of valentines that never came and those whose names were never called when choosing sides for basketballit was long ago and far away the world was younger than today when dreams were all they gave for free to ugly duckling girls like mewe all play the game and when we dare to cheat ourselves at solitaire inventing lovers on the phone repenting other lives unknownthey call and say come dance with me and murmur vague obscenities at ugly girls like me at seventeen

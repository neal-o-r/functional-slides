 love soft as an easy chair love fresh as the morning air one love that is shared by two i have found with youhey like a rose under the april snow oh yeah oh yeah i was always certain love would grow oh love ageless and evergreen ever ever green and seldom seen seldom seen by twoyou and i will make each night a first everyday a new beginning oh everyday a beginning darling do you know you make my spirits rise spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed ooh they warm and excite us oh cause we have the brightest lovetwo lives that shine as one morning glory and midnight sun time time weve learned to sail above oh oh time time wont change the meaning of one love ageless and ever ever ever evergreen evergreen

 i have often dreamed of a far off place where a heros welcome would be waiting for me where the crowds would cheer when they see my face and a voice keeps saying this is where im meant to beill be there someday i can go the distance i will find my way if i can be strong i know every mile would be worth my while when i go the distance ill be right where i belongdown an unknown road to embrace my fate though that road may wander it will lead me to you and a thousand years would be worth the wait it might take a lifetime but somehow ill see it throughand i wont look back i can go the distance and ill stay on track no i wont accept defeat its an uphill slope but i wont loose hope till i go the distance and my journey is complete oh yeahbut to look beyond the glory is the hardest part for a heros strength is measured by his heart ohlike a shooting star i will go the distance i will search the world i will face its harms i dont care how far i can go the distance till i find my heros welcome waiting in your armsi will search the world i will face its harms till i find my heros welcome waiting in your arms

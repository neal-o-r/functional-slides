 if i could save time in a bottle the first thing that id like to do is to save every day til eternity passes away just to spend them with youif i could make days last forever if words could make wishes come true id save every day like a treasure and then again i would spend them with youbut there never seems to be enough time to do the things you want to do once you find them ive looked around enough to know that youre the one i want to go through time withif i had a box just for wishes and dreams that had never come true the box would be empty except for the memory of how they were answered by you

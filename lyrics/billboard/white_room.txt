 in the white room with black curtains near the station blackroof country no gold pavements tired starlings silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes dawnlight smiles on you leaving my contentment ill wait in this place where the sun never shineswait in this place where the shadows run from themselves you said no strings could secure you at the station platform ticket restless diesels goodbye windows i walked into such a sad time at the station as i walked out felt my own need just beginning ill wait in the queue when the trains come backlie with you where the shadows run from themselves at the party she was kindness in the hard crowd consolation for the old wound now forgotten yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes shes just dressing goodbye windows tired starlings ill sleep in this place with the lonely crowdlie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves

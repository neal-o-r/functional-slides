 staring at a maple leaf leaning on the mother tree i said to myself we all lost touch your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries and seedless watermelon ohhhh nothing from the ground is good enough body raised it puts over mechorus oh chariot your golden waves are walking down upon this face oh chariot im singing out loud to guide me give me your strengthremember seeking moons of birth rings made mirrors of the earth the sun was just yellow energy it is a living promise land even over fields of sand seasons fill my mind and cover me from bringing back more than a memorychorusyoull be my vacation away from this place you know what i want holding that cup its pouring over the sides make me want to spread my arms and flychorusyour be my vacation away from this place you know what i want holding that cup its pouring over to the sides make me want to spread my arms and flychorus

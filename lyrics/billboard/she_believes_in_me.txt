 while she lays sleeping i stay out late at night and play my songs and sometimes all the nights can be so long and its good when i finally make it home all alone while she lays dreaming i try to get undressed without the light and quietly she says how was your night and i come to her and say it was all right and i hold her tightand she believes in me ill never know just what she sees in me i told her someday if she was my girl i could change the world with my little songs i was wrong but she has faith in me and so i go on trying faithfully and who knows maybe on some special night if my song is right i will find a way find a waywhile she lays waiting i stumble to the kitchen for a bite then i see my old guitar in the night just waiting for me like a secret friend and theres no end while she lays crying i fumble with a melody or two and im torn between the things that i should do and she says to wake her up when i am through god her love is trueand she believes in me ill never know just what she sees in me i told her someday if she was my girl i could change the world with my little songs i was wrong but she has faith in me and so i go on trying faithfully and who knows maybe on some special night if my song is right i will find a way

 shes faced the hardest times you could imagine and many times her eyes fought back the tears and when her youthful world was about to fall in each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears and a sorrow no one hears still rings in midnight silence in her earslet her cry for shes a lady let her dream for shes a child let the rain fall down upon her shes a free and gentle flower growing wildand if by chance i should hold her let me hold her for a time but if allowed just one possession i would pick her from the garden to be minebe careful how you touch her for shell awaken and sleeps the only freedom that she knows and when you walk into her eyes you wont believe the way shes always paying for a debt she never owes and a silent wind still blows that only she can hear and so she goes

 we walked to the sea just my father and me and the dogs played around on the sand winter cold cut the air hanging still everywhere dressed in gray did he say hold my handi said loves easier when its far away we sat and watched a distant lightwere two ships that pass in the night we both smile and we say its alright were still here its just that were out of sight like those ships that pass in the nighttheres a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky theres another that rides far behind and it seems you and i are like strangers a wide ways apart as we drift on through timehe said its harder now were far away we only read you when you writewere two ships that pass in the night and we smile when we say its alright were still here its just that were out of sight like those ships that pass in the nightwere those ships that pass in the night and we smile when we say its alright were still here its just that were out of sight like those ships that pass in the nightwere just two ships that pass in the night and we smile when we say its alright were still here its just that were out of sight

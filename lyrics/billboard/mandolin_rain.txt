 the song came and went like the times that we spent hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent i laughed and shed smile it would last for awhile you dont know what you got till you lose it all againlisten to the mandolin rain listen to the music on the lake listen to my heart break every time she runs away listen to the banjo wind sad song drifting low listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to goa cool evening dance listening to the bluegrass band takes the chill from the air till they play the last song ill do my time oh keeping you off my mind but theres moments that i find im not feeling so stronglisten to the mandolin rain listen to the music on the lake listen to my heart break every time she runs away listen to the banjo wind sad song drifting low listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to gorunning down by the lake shore she did love the sound of a summer storm it played on the lake like a mandolin now its washing her away once again againwhoa oh oh yeah listen to do do dothe boats steaming in i watch the side wheel spin and i think about her when i hear that whistle blow i cant change my mind oh i knew all the time that shed go but thats a choice i made long agolisten to the mandolin rain listen to the music on the lake listen to my heart break every time she runs away listen to the banjo wind sad song drifting low listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go as she turns to golisten to the listen to the mandolin rain listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go listen to the tears roll down my face as she turns to go listen to the mandolin rain

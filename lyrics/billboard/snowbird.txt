 beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean the unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green the snowbird sings the song he always sings and speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in springwhen i was young my heart was young then too anything that it would tell me thats the thing that i would do but now i feel such emptiness within for the thing that i want most in lifes the thing thing that i cant winspread your tiny wings and fly away and take the snow back with you where it came from on that day the one i love forever is untrue and if i could you know that i would fly away with youthe breeze along the river seems to say that hell only break me heart again should i decide to stay so little snowbird take me with you when you go to that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow

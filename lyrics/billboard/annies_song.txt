 you fill up my senses like a night in a forest like the mountains in springtime like a walk in the rain like a storm in the desert like a sleepy blue ocean you fill up my senses come fill me againcome let me love you let me give my life to you let me drown in your laughter let me die in your arms let me lay down beside you let me always be with you come let me love you come love me againlet me give my life to you come let me love you come love me againyou fill up my senses like a night in a forest like the mountains in springtime like a walk in the rain like a storm in the desert like a sleepy blue ocean you fill up my senses come fill me again

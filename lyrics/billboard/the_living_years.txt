every generation blames the one before and all of their frustrations come beating on your door i know that im a prisoner to all my father held so dear i know that im a hostage to all his hopes and fears i just wish i could have told him in the living years crumpled bits of paper filled with imperfect thought stilted conversations im afraid thats all weve got you say you just dont see it he says its perfect sense you just cant get agreement in this present tense we all talk a different language talking in defense say it loud say it clear you can listen as well as you hear its too late when we die to admit we dont see eye to eye so we open up a quarrel between the present and the past we only sacrifice the future its the bitterness that lasts so dont yield to the fortunes you sometimes see as fate it may have a new perspective on a different day and if you dont give up and dont give in you may just be okay say it loud say it clear you can listen as well as you hear its too late when we die to admit we dont see eye to eye i wasnt there that morning when my father passed away i didnt  get to tell him all the things i had to say i think i caught his spirit later that same year im sure i heard his echo in my babys new born tears i just wish i could have told him in the living years say it loud say it clear you can listen as well as you hear its too late when we die to admit we dont see eye to eye

 longer than therve been fishes in the ocean higher than any bird ever flew longer than thereve been stars up in the heavens ive been in love with youstronger than any mountain cathedral truer than any tree ever grew deeper than any forest primeval i am in love with youill bring fire in the winters youll send showers in the springs well fly through the falls and summers with love on our wingsthrough the years as the fire starts to mellow burning lines in the book of our lives though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow ill be in love with you ill be in love with you

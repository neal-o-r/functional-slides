 like a warrior that fights and wins the battle i know the taste of victorythough i went through some nights consumed by the shadows i was crippled emotionallysomehow i made it through the heartache yes i did i escaped i found my way out of the darkness i kept my faith kept my faithwhen the river was deep i didnt falter when the mountain was high i still believed when the valley was low it didnt stop me no no i knew you were waiting knew you were waiting for mewith and endless desire i i kept on searching sure in time our eyes would meetlike the bridge is on fire the hurt is over one touch and you set me freeno i dont regret a single moment no i dont looking back when i think of all those disappointments i just laugh i just laughwhen the river was deep i didnt falter when the mountain was high i still believed when the valley was low it didnt stop me i knew you were waiting knew you were waiting for meso we were drawn together through destiny i know this love we share was meant to beknew you were waiting knew you were waiting i knew you were waiting knew you were waiting for mei didnt falter i still believed when the valley was low it didnt stop me knew you were waiting knew you were waiting for mei didnt falter i still believed when the valley was low it didnt stop me knew you were waiting knew you were waiting for mei didnt falter i still believed it didnt stop me knew you were waitingi didnt falter i still believed it didnt stop me

in the morning fun when no one will be drinking any more wine ill wake the sun up by givin him a fresh air full of the wind cup and i wont be found in the shadows hiding sorrow and i can wait for fate to bring around to me any part of my tomorrow tomorrow cause its oh so peaceful here theres no one bending over my shoulder nobody breathing in my ear oh so peaceful here in the evening shadows are callin me and the dew settles in my mind and i think of friends in the yesterday when my plans were giggled in rhyme i had a son while on the run and his love brought a tear to my eye and maybe some day hell up and say we had a pretty nice time oh my cause its oh so peaceful here theres no one bending over my shoulder nobody breathing in my ear oh so peaceful here

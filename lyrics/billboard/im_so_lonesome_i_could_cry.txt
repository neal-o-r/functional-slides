 did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill he sounds too blue to fly the midnight train is whining low and im so lonesome i could crydid you ever see a night so long when time goes crawlin by the moon just went behind a cloud and im so lonesome i could crydid you ever see a robin weep when leaves begin to die that means hes lost the will to live and im so lonesome i could crythe silence of a fallin star lights up a purple sky and as i wonder where you are im so lonesome i could cry

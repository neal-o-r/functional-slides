 once in every life someone comes along and you came to me it was almost like a songyou were in my arms right where you belong and we were so in love it was almost like a songjanuary through december we had such a perfect year then the flame became a dying ember all at once you werent herenow my broken heart cries for you each night and its almost like a song but its much too sad to writenow my broken heart cries for you each night and its almost like a song but its much too sad to writeits too sad to write

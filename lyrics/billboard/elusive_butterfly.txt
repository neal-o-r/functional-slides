 you might wake up some morning to the sound of something moving past your window in the wind and if youre quick enough to rise youll catch the fleeting glimpse of someones fading shadowout on the new horizon you may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings and if the sleep has left your ears you might hear footsteps running through an open meadowdont be concerned it will not harm you its only me pursuing something im not sure of across my dreams with nets of wonder i chase the bright elusive butterfly of loveyou might have heard my footsteps echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind i might have even called your name as i ran searching after something to believe inyou might have seen me runnin through the long abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind if you remember something there that glided past you followed close by heavy breathingdont be concerned it will not harm you its only me pursuing something im not sure of across my dreams with nets of wonder i chase the bright elusive butterfly of loveacross my dreams with nets of wonder i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

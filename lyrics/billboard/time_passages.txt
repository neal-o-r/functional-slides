 it was late in december the sky turned to snow all round the day was goin down slow night like a river beginning to flow i felt the beat of my mind go drifting into time passages years go falling in the fading light time passages buy me a ticket on the last train home tonightwell im not the kind to live in the past the years run too short and the days too fast the things you lean on are the things that dont last well its just now and then my line gets cast into these time passages theres something back here that you left behind oh time passages buy me a ticket on the last train home tonighthear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn dont know why you should feel that theres something to learn its just a game that you playwell the picture is changingnow youre part of a crowd theyre laughing at something and the musics loud a girl comes towards you you once used to know you reach out your hand but youre all alone in these time passages i know youre in there youre just out of sight oh time passages buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

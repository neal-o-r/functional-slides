 if theres one thing in my life thats missing its the time that i spend alone sailing on the cool and bright clear water theres lots of those friendly people theyre showing me ways to go but i never want to lose their inspirationtime for a cool change i know that its time for a cool change and i know that my life is so prearranged i know that its time for a cool changewell i was born in the sign of water and its there where i feel my best the albatross and the whales they are my brothers its kind of a special feeling when youre out on the sea alone staring at the full moon like a loverive never been romantic and sometimes i dont care i know it may sound selfish but let me breathe the air

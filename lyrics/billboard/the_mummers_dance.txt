 when in the springtime of the year when the trees are crowned with leaves when the ash and oak and the birch and yew are dressed in ribbons fairwhen owls call the breathless moon in the blue veil of the night the shadows of the trees appear amidst the lantern lightweve been rambling all the night and some time of this day now returning back again we bring a garland gaywho will go down to those shady groves and summon the shadows there and tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms in the springtime of the yearthe songs of birds seem to fill the wood that when the fiddler plays all their voices can be heard long past their woodland daysweve been rambling all the night and some time of this day now returning back again we bring a garland gayand so they linked their hands and danced round in circles and in rows and so the journey of the night descends when all the shades are gonea garland gay we bring you here and at your door we stand it is a sprout well budded out the work of our lords handweve been rambling all the night and some time of this day now returning back again we bring a garland gayweve been rambling all the night and some time of this day now returning back again we bring a garland gay

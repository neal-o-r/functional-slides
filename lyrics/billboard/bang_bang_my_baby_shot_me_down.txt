i was five and he was six  we rode on horses made of sticks  he wore black and i wore white  he would always win the fight  bang bang he shot me down  bang bang i hit the ground  bang bang that awful sound  bang bang my baby shot me down  seasons came and changed the time  and i grew up i called him mine  he would always laugh and say  remember when we used to play  bang bang i shot you down  bang bang you hit the ground  bang bang that awful sound  bang bang i used to shoot you down  music played and people sang  just for me the church bells rang  now hes gone i dont know why  until this days sometimes i cry  he didnt even say goodbye  he didnt take the time to lie  bang bang he shot me down  bang bang i hit the ground  bang bang that awful sound  bang bang my baby shot me down

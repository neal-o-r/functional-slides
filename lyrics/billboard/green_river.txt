 well take me back down where cool water flow yeh let me remember things i love stoppin at the log where catfish bite walkin along the river road at night barefoot girls dancin in the moonlighti can hear the bull frog callin me wonder if my ropes still hangin to the tree love to kick my feet way down the shallow water shoe fly dragon fly get back t your mother pick up a flat rock skip it across green riverup at codys camp i spent my days oh with flat car riders and crosstie walkers old cody junior took me over said youre gonna find the world is smouldrin an if you get lost come on home to green river well come home

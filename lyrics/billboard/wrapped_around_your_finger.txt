 you consider me the young apprentice caught between the scylla and charibdes hypnotized by you if i should linger staring at the ring around your fingeri have only come here seeking knowledge things they would not teach me of in college i can see the destiny you sold turned into a shining band of goldill be wrapped around your finger ill be wrapped around your finger mephistopheles is not your name i know what youre up to just the same i will listen hard to your tuition you will see it come to its fruition ill be wrapped around your finger ill be wrapped around your fingerdevil and the deep blue sea behind me vanish in the air youll never find me i will turn your face to alabaster when youll find your servant is your master

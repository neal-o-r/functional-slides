i dig rock and roll music and i love to get the chance to play and sing it i figure its about the happiest sound goin down today the message may not move me or mean a great deal to me but hey it feels so groovy to say i dig the mamas and the papas at the trip sunset strip in la and they got a good thing goin when the words dont get in the way and when theyre really wailing michelle and cass are sailin hey they really nail me to the wall donovan incomprehensible in a dream like tripped out way his crystal images tell you bout a brighter day and when the beatles tell you theyve got a word love to sell you they mean exactly what they say i dig oh rock and roll music i could really get it on in that scene i think i could say somethin if you know what i mean but if i really say it the radio wont play it unless i lay it between the lines

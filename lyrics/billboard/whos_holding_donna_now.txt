 sometimes a love wont get cold hard as i try i know for sure everybody is telling me youll be over her eventually but how am i suppose to feel so securechorus when i keep wondering whos holding donna now when i keep wondering whos heart shes knocking around theres nothing i wouldnt do to be in his shoes right now and i keep wondering whos holding donna now and i keep wondering what magic can be found to turn me back to the one whos holding donna nowher letter started with goodbye ive read it half a million times tell me this is just a dream when i wake up shell be her next to me tell me it will be just the way it waschorus

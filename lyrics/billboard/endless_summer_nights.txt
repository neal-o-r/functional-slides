 summer came and left without a warning all at once i looked and you were gone and now youre looking back at me searching for a way that we can be like we were beforenow im back to what i knew before you somehow the city doesnt look the same id give my life for one more night of having you here to hold me tight oh please take me there again oh ohand i remember how you loved me time was all we had until the day we said goodbye i remember every moment of those endless summer nightsi still recall the walks along the beaches and the way your hair would glisten in the sun rising in the afternoon making love to you under the moon ohdo you remember all the nights we spent in silence every single breath you took was mine we can have it all again say that youll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine oh ohand i remember how you loved me time was all we had until the day we said goodbye i remember every moment of those endless summer nightstheres only so much i can say so please dont run away from what we have together its only you and me tonight so lets stay lost in flight oh wont you please surrenderand i remember how you loved me time was all we had until the day we said goodbye i remember every moment of those endless summer nights oh i rememberand i remember how you loved me time was all we had until the day we said goodbye i remember every moment of those endless summer nights

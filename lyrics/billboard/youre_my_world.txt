 youre my world youre every breath i take youre my world youre every move i make other eyes see the stars up in the sky but for me they shine within your eyesas the trees reach for the sun above so my arms reach out to you for love with your hand resting in mine i feel a power so divineyoure my world you are my night and day youre my world youre every prayer i pray if our love ceases to be then its the end of my world for mewith your hand resting in mine i feel a power so divine

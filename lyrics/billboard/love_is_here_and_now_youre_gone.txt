 love is here and oh my darling now youre gone love is here and oh my darling now youre gone you persuaded me to love you and i did but instead of tenderness i found heartache instead into your arms i fell so unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there you closed the door of your heart and turned the key locked your love away from melove is here and oh my darling now youre gone you made me love you and oh my darling now youre gone you said loving you would make life beautiful with each passing day but as soon as love came into my heart you turned and you walked just one way you stripped me of my dreams you gave me faith then took my hope look at me nowlook at me see what loving you has done to me look at my face see how crying has left its trace after you made me all your own and you left me all alone you made your words sound so sweet knowing that your love i couldnt keep my heart cries out for your touch but youre not there and the lonely cry fades in the airlove is here and oh my darling now youre gone love is here and oh my darling now youre gone you made me love you oh my darling now youre gone you made me love you oh my darling now youre gone

 when dreaming im guided to another world time and time again at sunrise i fight to stay asleep cause i dont want to leave the comfort of this place cause theres a hunger a longing to escape from the life i live when im awake so lets go there lets make our escape come on lets go there lets ask can we staycan you take me higher to the place where blind men see can you take me higher to the place with golden streetsalthough i would like our world to change it helps me to appreciate those nights and those dreams but my friend id sacrifice all those nights if i could make the earth and my dreams the same the only difference is to let love replace all our hate so lets go there lets make our escape come on lets go there lets ask can we staycan you take me higher to the place where blind men see can you take me higher to the place with golden streetsso lets go there so lets go there come on lets go there lets ask can we stayup high i feel like im alive for the very first time set up high im strong enough to take these dreams and make them mineset up high im strong enough to take these dreams and make them minecan you take me higher to the place where blind men see can you take me higher to the place with golden streetscan you take me higher to the place where blind men see can you take me higher to the place with golden streets

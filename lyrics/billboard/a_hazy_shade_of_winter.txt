time time time see whats become of me while i looked around for my possibilities i was so hard to please look around leaves are brown and the sky is a hazy shade of winter hear the salvation army band down by the riversides bound to be a better ride than what youve got planned carry your gun in your hand look around leaves are brown and the sky is a hazy shade of winter hang on to your hopes my friend thats an easy thing to say but if your hopes should pass away simply pretend that you can build them again look around the grass is high the fields are ripe its the springtime of my life seasons change with the scenery weaving time in a tapestry wont you stop and remember me look around leaves are brown and the sky is a hazy shade of winter look around leaves are brown theres a patch of snow on the ground 3x

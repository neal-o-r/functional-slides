 last night i waved goodbye now it seems years im back in the city where nothing is clear but thoughts of me holding you bringing us nearand tell me when will our eyes meet when can i touch you when will this strong yearning end and when will i hold you againtime in new england took me away to long rocky beaches and you by the bay we started a story whose end must now waitand tell me when will our eyes meet when can i touch you when will this strong yearning end and when will i hold you againi feel the change comin i feel the wind blow i feel brave and daring i feel my blood flow with you i could bring out all the love that i have with you theres a heaven so earth aint so badand tell me when will our eyes meet when can i touch you when will this strong yearning end and when will i hold you again again

 on a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness by a freeway i confess i was lost in the pages of a book full of death reading how well die alone and if were good well lay to rest anywhere we want to goin your house i long to be room by room patiently ill wait for you there like a stone ill wait for you there alone  meaning  bybetsy     only a junkie can truly understand the meaning and depth of this songs lyrics    see all   on my deathbed i will pray to the gods and the angels like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven to a place i recall i was there so long ago the sky was bruised the wine was bled and there you led me onin your house i long to be room by room patiently ill wait for you there like a stone ill wait for you there alonealoneand on i read until the day was gone and i sat in regret of all the things ive done for all that ive blessed and all that ive wronged in dreams until my death i will wander onin your house i long to be room by room patiently ill wait for you there like a stone ill wait for you there alonealone

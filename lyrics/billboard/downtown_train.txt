 outside another yellow moon has punched a hole in the night time mist i climb through the window and down to the street im shining like a new dime the downtown trains are full full of all them brooklyn girls they try so hard to break out of their little worldsyou wave your hand and they scatter like crows they have nothing thatll ever capture your heart theyre just thorns without the rose be careful of them in the dark oh if i was the one you chose to be your only one oh baby cant you hear me now cant you hear me nowwill i see you tonight on a downtown train every night every night its just the same on a downtown traini know your window and i know its late i know your stairs and your doorway i walk down your street and past your gate i stand by the light of the four way and watch them as they fall oh baby they all having their heart attacks they stay at the carnival but theyll never win you backwill i see you tonight on a downtown train every night every night its just the same you leave me lonely will i see you tonight on a downtown train all my dreams all my dreams fall like rain on a downtown trainwill i see you tonight on a downtown train every night every night its just the samewill i see you tonight on a downtown train all my dreams all my dreams fall like rain on a downtown train on a downtown train all my dreams fall like rain on a downtown train

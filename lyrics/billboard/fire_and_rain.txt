 just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone susanne the plans they made put an end to you i walked out this morning and i wrote down this song i just cant remember who to send it toive seen fire and ive seen rain ive seen sunny days that i thought would never end ive seen lonely times when i could not find a friend but i always thought that id see you againwont you look down upon me jesus youve got to help me make a stand youve just got to see me through another day my bodys aching and my time is at hand and i wont make it any other wayoh ive seen fire and ive seen rain ive seen sunny days that i thought would never end ive seen lonely times when i could not find a friend but i always thought that id see you againbeen walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun lord knows when the cold wind blows itll turn your head around well theres hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the groundoh ive seen fire and ive seen rain ive seen sunny days that i thought would never end ive seen lonely times when i could not find a friend but i always thought that id see you baby one more time again nowthought id see you one more time again theres just a few things coming my way this time around now thought id see you thought id see you fire and rain now

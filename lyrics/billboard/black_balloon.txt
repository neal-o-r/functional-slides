 babys black balloon makes her fly i almost fell into that hole in your life and youre not thinking about tomorrow cause you were the same as me but on your kneesa thousand other boys could never reach you how could i have been the one i saw the world spin beneath you and scatter like ice from the spoon that was your wombcomin down the world turned over and angels fall without you there and i go on as you get colder or are you someones prayeryou know the lies that they always told you and the love you never knew whats the things they never showed you that swallowed the light from the sun inside your roomcomin down the world turned over and angels fall without you there and i go on as you get colder or are you someones prayerand theres no time left for losin when you stand they fall comin down the world turned over and angels fall without you there and i go on as you grow colder all because im comin down the years turn over and angels fall without you there and ill go on to bring you home all because im all because im and ill become what you became to me

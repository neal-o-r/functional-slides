a winters day in a deep and dark december i am alone gazing from my window to the streets below on a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow i am a rock i am an island ive built walls a fortress steep and mighty that none may penetrate i have no need of friendship friendship causes pain its laughter and its loving i disdain i am a rock i am an island dont talk of love well ive heard the word before its sleeping in my memory i wont disturb the slumber of feelings that have died if i never loved i never would have cried i am a rock i am an island i have my books and my poetry to protect me i am shielded in my armor hiding in my room safe within my womb i touch no one and no one touches me i am a rock i am an island and a rock feels no pain and an island never cries

 i remember all my life raining down as cold as ice a shadow of a man a face through a window crying in the night the night goes intomorning just another day happy people pass my way looking in their eyes i see a memory i never realized how happy you made me oh mandywell you came and you gave without taking but i sent you away oh mandy and you kissed me and stopped me from shaking and i need you today oh mandyim standing on the edge of time walked away when love was mine caught up in a world of uphill climbing the tears are in my eyes and nothing is rhyming oh mandywell you came and you gave without taking but i sent you away oh mandy and you kissed me and stopped me from shaking and i need you today oh mandyyesterdays a dream i face the morning crying on a breeze the pain is calling oh mandywell you came and you gave without taking but i sent you away oh mandy well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking and i need you today oh mandywell you came and you gave without taking but i sent you away oh mandy you kissed me and stopped me from shaking and i need you

 across the street the river runs down in the gutter life is slipping away let me still exist in another place running down under cover of a helicopter bladethe flames are getting higher in effigy burning down the bridges of my memory love may still alive somewhere someday where theyre downing only deer a hundred steel towns awayoh rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum with the words i love you rolling off my tongue no never will i roam for i know my place is home where the ocean meets the sky ill be sailingphotographs and kerosene light up my darkness light it up light it up i can still feel the touch of your thin blue jeans running down the alley ive got my eyes all over you baby oh babyoh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum with the words i love you rolling off my tongue no never will i roam for i know my place is home where the ocean meets the sky ill be sailingoh yeahoh ive got lightning in my veins shifting like the handle of a slot machine love may still exist in another place im just yanking back the handle no expression on my faceoh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum with the words i love you rolling off my tongue no never will i roam for i know my place is home where the ocean meets the sky ill be sailingoh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum with the words i love you rolling off my tongue no never will i roam for i know my place is home where the ocean meets the sky ill be sailingthe rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum with the words i love you rolling off my tongue no never will i roam for i know my place is home where the ocean meets the sky ill be sailing

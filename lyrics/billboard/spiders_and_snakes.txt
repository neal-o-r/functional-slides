i remember when mary lou said you wanna walk me home from school well i said yes i do she said i dont have to go right home and im the kind that likes to be alone as long as you would i said me too and so we took a stroll wound up down by the swimmin hole and she said do what you wanna do i got silly and found a frog in the water by a hollow log and i shook it at her and i said this frogs for you she said i dont like spiders and snakes and that aint what it takes to love me you fool you fool i dont like spiders and snakes and that aint what it takes to love me like i wanna be loved by you well i think of that girl from time to time i call her up when i got a dime i say hello baby she says aint you cool i say do you remember when and would you like to get together again she says ill see you after school i was shy and so for a while most of my love was touch and smile till she said come on over here i was nervous as you might guess still looking for somethin to slip down her dress and she said lets make it perfectly clear she said i dont like spiders and snakes and that aint what it takes to love me you fool you fool i dont like spiders and snakes and that aint what it takes to love me like i wanna be loved by you

i was tired of my lady wed been together too long like a wornout recording of a favorite song so while she lay there sleeping i read the paper in bed and in the personals column there was this letter i read if you like pina coladas and getting caught in the rain if youre not into yoga if you have halfabrain if you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape im the lady youve looked for write to me and escape i didnt think about my lady i know that sounds kind of mean but me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine so i wrote to the paper took out a personal ad and though im nobodys poet i thought it wasnt halfbad yes i like pina coladas and getting caught in the rain im not much into health food i am into champagne ive got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape at a bar called omalleys where well plan our escape so i waited with high hopes then she walked in the place i knew her smile in an instant i knew the curve of her face it was my own lovely lady and she said oh its you and we laughed for a moment and i said i never knew that you liked pina coladas and getting caught in the rain and the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne if you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape youre the love that ive looked for come with me and escape if you like pina coladas and getting caught in the rain and the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne if you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape youre the love that ive looked for come with me and escape

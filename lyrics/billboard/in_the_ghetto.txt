 as the snow flies on a cold and gray chicago mornin a poor little baby child is born in the ghetto in the ghettoand his mama cries cause if theres one thing that she dont need its another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto in the ghettopeople dont you understand the child needs a helping hand or hell grow to be an angry young man some day take a look at you and me are we too blind to see do we simply turn our heads and look the other waywell the world turns and a hungry little boy with a runny nose plays in the street as the cold wind blows in the ghetto in the ghettoand his hunger burns so he starts to roam the streets at night and he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto in the ghettothen one night in desperation a young man breaks away he buys a gun steals a car tries to run but he dont get far and his mama criesas a crowd gathers round an angry young man face down on the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto in the ghettoand as her young man dies on a cold and gray chicago mornin another little baby child is born in the ghetto in the ghettoand his mama cries in the ghetto in the ghetto aahaah

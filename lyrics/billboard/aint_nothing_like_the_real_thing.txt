aint nothing like the real thing baby aint nothing like the real thing aint nothing like the real thing baby aint nothing like the real thing tammi terrell i got your picture hangin on the wall it cant see or come to me when i call your name i realize its just a picture in a frame marvin gaye i read your letters when youre not near but they dont move me and they dont groove me like when i hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear both aint nothing like the real thing baby aint nothing like the real thing tammi i play the game a fantasy i pretend but im not in reality i need the shelter of your arms to comfort me both no other sound is quite the same as your name no touch can do half as much to make me feel better so lets stay together marvin i got some memories to look back on and though they help me when you phone im well aware nothing can take the place of being there both so glad we got the real thing baby so glad we got the real thing aint nothing like the real thing baby aint nothing like the real thing aint nothing like the real thing baby aint nothing like the real thing

 i walk along the avenue i never thought id meet a girl like you meet a girl like youwith auburn hair and tawny eyes the kind of eyes that hypnotize me through you hypnotize me throughand i ran i ran so far away i just ran i ran all night and day i couldnt get awaya cloud appears above your head a beam of light comes shining down on you shining down on youthe cloud is moving nearer still aurora borealis comes in view aurora comes in viewand i ran i ran so far away i just ran i ran all night and day i couldnt get awayreached out a hand to touch your face youre slowly disappearing from my view disappearing from my viewreached out a hand to try again im floating in a beam of light with you a beam of light with youand i ran i ran so far away i just ran i ran all night and dayand i ran i ran so far away i just ran i ran all night and day

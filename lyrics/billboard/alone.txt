 i hear the ticking of the clock im lying here the rooms pitch dark i wonder where you are tonight no answer on the telephone and the night goes by so very slow oh i hope that it wont end though alonetill now i always got by on my own i never really cared until i met you and now it chills me to the bone how do i get you alone how do i get you aloneyou dont know how long i have wanted to touch your lips and hold you tight oh you dont know how long i have waited and i was going to tell you tonight but the secret is still my own and my love for you is still unknown alonetill now i always got by on my own i never really cared until i met you and now it chills me to the bone how do i get you alone how do i get you alonehow do i get you alone how do i get you alonealone alone

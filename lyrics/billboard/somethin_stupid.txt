i know i stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me and if we go someplace to dance i know that theres a chance you wont be leaving with me and afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two and then i go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like i love you i can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lines you heard the night before and though its just a line to you for me its true and never seemed so right before i practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true but then i think ill wait until the evening gets late and im alone with you the time is right your perfume fills my head the stars get red and oh the nights so blue and then i go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like i love you

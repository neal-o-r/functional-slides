 i realize youre seein someone new i dont believe she knows you like i do your temperamental moody side the one you always try to hide from mebut i know when you have something on your mind youve been tryin to tell me for the longest time and before you break my heart in two theres something ive been trying to say to youbut the words get in the way theres so much i want to say but its locked deep inside and if you look in my eyes we might fall in love again wont even start to cry and before we say goodbye i tried to say i love you but the words got in the wayyour heart has always been an open door but baby i dont even know you anymore and despite the fact its hurting me i know the time has come to set you free

 the sun goes down the night rolls in you can feel it starting all over again the moon comes up and the music calls youre getting tired of staring at the same four walls youre out of your room and down on the street moving through the crowds through the midnight heat the traffic roars and the sirens scream you look at the faces its just like a dreamnobody knows where youre going nobody cares where youve beencause you belong to the city you belong to the night living in a river of darkness beneath the neon light you were born in the city concrete under your feet its in your moves its in your blood youre a man of the streetwhen you said goodbye you were on the run tryin to get away from the things youd done now youre back again and youre feeling strange so much has happened but nothing has changedyou still dont know where youre going your still just a face in the crowdyou belong to the city you belong to the night living in a river of darkness beneath the neon light you were born in the city concrete under your feet its in your blood its in your moves youre a man of the streetyou can feel it you can taste it you can see it you can face it you can hear it youre getting near it you want to make it cause you can take ityou belong to the city you belong to the night you belong to the city you belong to the night you belong you belong

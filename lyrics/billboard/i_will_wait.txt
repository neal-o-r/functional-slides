well i came home like a stone and i fell heavy into your arms these days of dust  wish we wouldve known will blow away with this new sun but ill kneel down wait for now ill kneel down know my ground i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you so bring my step and relent you forgave and i wont forget know what weve seen and him with less  knowing some way to shake the excess i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you now ill be bold as well as strong and use my head along side my heart so tame my flesh and fix my eyes a tethered mind freed from the lies but ill kneel down wait for now ill kneel down know my ground instrumental raise my hands paint my spirit gold bow my head feel my heart slow i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you

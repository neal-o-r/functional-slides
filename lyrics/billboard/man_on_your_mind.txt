 i can feel it floating away inch by inch day by day love boat set itself free castaway slipping out to seai can feel it coming adrift even a blind man could see the rift from an ocean liner to a chinese junk there aint been a ship that cant be sunki used to dream it could last forever but pipe dreams never come true id be foolin myself if i never thought something like this couldnt happen to youi said baby youve got a man on your mind you got a weight on your shoulders how you ever gonna find the words to say goodbyeyou dont know just what you got till its gone i guess you heard that a lot but its true its not just a game you cant change your life by changing your nameits not something you can hide away sooner or later it starts to show its written on your face youve been betrayed do you really believe that i dont knowi said baby youve got a man on your mind you got a weight on your shoulders how you ever gonna find the words to say goodbyeits already fallen so its no use to fight and if he starts callin let him know youre with me for the rest of the nightoh i said baby youve got a man on your mind you got a weight on your shoulders how you ever gonna find the words to say goodbyebaby youve got a man on your mind you got a weight on your shoulders how you ever gonna find the words to say goodbyebaby youve got a man on your mind you got a weight on your shoulders how you ever gonna find the words to say goodbyebaby youve got a man on your mind

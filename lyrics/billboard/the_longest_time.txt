 oh oh oh for the longest time oh oh oh for the longest if you said goodbye to me tonight there would still be music left to write what else could i do im so inspired by you that hasnt happened for the longest timeonce i thought my innocence was gone now i know that happiness goes on thats where you found me when you put your arms around me i havent been there for the longest timeoh oh oh for the longest time oh oh oh for the longest im that voice youre hearing in the hall and the greatest miracle of all is how i need you and how you needed me too that hasnt happened for the longest timemaybe this wont last very long but you feel so right and i could be wrong maybe ive been hoping too hard but ive gone this far and its more than i hoped forwho knows how much further well go on maybe ill be sorry when youre gone ill take my chances i forgot how nice romance is i havent been there for the longest timei had second thoughts at the start i said to myself hold on to your heart now i know the woman that you are youre wonderful so far and its more than i hoped fori dont care what consequence it brings i have been a fool for lesser things i want you so bad i think you ought to know that i intend to hold you for the longest time

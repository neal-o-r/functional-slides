 i close my eyes only for a moment and the moments gone all my dreams pass before my eyes a curiosity dust in the wind all they are is dust in the windsame old song just a drop of water in an endless sea all we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see dust in the wind all we are is dust in the wind oh ho honow dont hang on nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky it slips away and all your money wont another minute buy dust in the wind all we are is dust in the wind all we are is dust in the wind dust in the wind everything is dust in the wind everything is dust in the wind the wind

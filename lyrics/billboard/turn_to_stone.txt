 the city streets are empty now the lights dont shine no more and so the songs are way down low turning turning turning a sound that flows into my mind the echoes of the daylight of everything that is alive in my blue worldi turn to stone when you are gone i turn to stone turn to stone when you comin home i cant go onthe dying embers of the night a fire that slowly fades till dawn still glow upon the wall so bright turning turning turning the tired streets that hide away from here to everywhere they go roll past my door into the day in my blue worldi turn to stone when you are gone i turn to stone turn to stone when you comin home i cant go on turn to stone when you are gone i turn to stoneyes im turnin to stone cause you aint comin home why you aint comin home if im turnin to stone youve been gone for so long and i cant carry on yes im turnin im turnin im turnin to stonethe dancing shadows on the wall the two step in the hall are all i see since youve been gone turning turning turning through all i sit here and i wait i turn to stone i turn to stone you will return again someday to my blue worldi turn to stone when you are gone i turn to stone turn to stone when you comin home i cant go on turn to stone when you are gone i turn to stonei turn to stone when you are gone i turn to stone turn to stone when you comin home i cant go on turn to stone when you are gone i turn to stone

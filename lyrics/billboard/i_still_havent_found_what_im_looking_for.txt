 i have climbed the highest mountains i have run through the fields only to be with you only to be with youi have run i have crawled i have scaled these city walls these city walls only to be with you but i still havent found what im looking for but i still havent found what im looking fori have kissed honey lips felt the healing in the fingertips it burned like fire this burning desire i have spoke with the tongue of angels i have held the hand of a devil it was warm in the night i was cold as a stone but i still havent found what im looking for but i still havent found what im looking fori believe in the kingdom come then all the colors will bleed into one bleed into one but yes im still running you broke the bonds and you you loosened the chains you carried the cross of my shame oh my shame you know i believe it but i still havent found what im looking for but i still havent found what im looking for

 your everlasting summer you can see it fading fast so you grab a piece of something that you think is gonna last well you wouldnt even know a diamond if you held it in your hand the things you think are precious i cant understandare you reelin in the years stowin away the time are you gatherin up the tears have you had enough of mineare you reelin in the years stowin away the time are you gatherin up the tears have you had enough of mineyou been tellin me youre a genius since you were seventeen in all the time ive known you i still dont know what you mean the weekend at the college didnt turn out like you planned the things that pass for knowledge i cant understandare you reelin in the years stowin away the time are you gatherin up the tears have you had enough of mineare you reelin in the years stowin away the time are you gatherin up the tears have you had enough of minei spent a lot of money and i spent a lot of time the trip we made to hollywood is etched upon my mind after all the things weve done and seen you find another man the things you think are useless i cant understandare you reelin in the years stowin away the time are you gatherin up the tears have you had enough of mineare you reelin in the years stowin away the time are you gatherin up the tears have you had enough of mine

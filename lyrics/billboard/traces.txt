 faded photographs covered now with lines and creases tickets torn in half memories in bits and pieces traces of love long ago that didnt work out right traces of loveribbons from her hair souvenirs of days together the ring she used to wear pages from an old love letter traces of love long ago that didnt work out right traces of love with me tonighti close my eyes and say a prayer that in her heart shell find a trace of love still there somewhere ohtraces of hope in the night that shell come back and try these traces of tears from my eyes oh yeah

more than an ocean keeps us apart i feel a tearing in half of my heart a walk on the water is all that i need but miracles are not happening youre not even listening to me leaving you aint easy now but loving yous the harder part you never want me for myself and ive needed you right from the very start oh wont you stay and try to give a little bit of heart and soul give a little bit of love to grow give a little bit of heart and soul and dont you make me beg for love give a sign cos i need to know give a little bit of heart and soul now listen to me i wish that i was wrong but you dont feel that way we drift apart with each passing day you never seem to notice any more living in a fantasy theres never any room to breath hoping every waking hour youll turn around and say that we can stay wont you even try to give a little bit of heart and soul give a little bit of love to grow give a little bit of heart and soul and dont you make me beg for love give a sign cos i need to know give a little bit of heart and soul somehow i lost my way looking to see something in your eyes but lover will never compromise there is the politics of life give a little bit of heart and soul give a little bit of love to grow give a little bit of heart and soul and dont you make me beg for love give a sign cos i need to know give a little bit of heart and soul

 i cried a tear you wiped it dry i was confused you cleared my mindi sold my soul you bought it back for me and held me up and gave me dignity somehow you needed meyou gave me strength to stand alone again to face the world out on my own againyou put me high upon a pedestal so high that i could almost see eternity you needed me you needed meand i cant believe its you i cant believe its true i needed you and you were thereand ill never leave why should i leave id be a fool cause ive finally found someone who really caresyou held my hand when it was cold when i was lost you took me homeyou gave me hope when i was at the end and turned my lies back into truth again you even called me friendyou gave me strength to stand alone again to face the world out on my own againyou put me high upon a pedestal so high that i could almost see eternity you needed me you needed me you needed me you needed me

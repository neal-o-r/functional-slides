 all my life was a paper once plain pure and white till you moved with your pen changin moods now and then till the balance was right then you added some music every note was in place and anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my faceand you decorated my life created a world where dreams are a part and you decorated my life by paintin your love all over my heart you decorated my lifelike a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song there was no harmony life meant nothin to me until you came along and you brought out the colors what a gentle surprise now im able to see all the things life can be shinin soft in your eyesand you decorated my life created a world where dreams are a part and you decorated my life by paintin your love all over my heart you decorated my life

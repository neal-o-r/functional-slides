 sure ive been in love a time or two but in the end i still chose you no one could ever make me feel this way thats why its killing me what were going throughsomehow thought tween me and you our love would stand the test of time and never ever fadechorus but were not making love no more were not even trying to change tell me how it slips away does it ever stay the same we dont even talk no more weve ran out of words to say tell me it dont have to change wont it ever stay the samegirl i know that things arent going right but dont you think it deserves a fight a love like ours dont happen everyday and were losing it right as we speakand if we dont wake up its a memory a time gone past a love that sailed awaychorusi dream of lovers past and i see a girl so sad cause she lost the only man she loved he went awaywell its not too late for us to changechorus

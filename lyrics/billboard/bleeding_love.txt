 closed off from love i didnt need the pain once or twice was enough but it was all in vain time starts to pass before you know it youre frozen but something happened for the very first time with you my heart melts into the ground found something true and everyones looking round thinking im going crazybut i dont care what they say im in love with you they try to pull me away but they dont know the truth my hearts crippled by the vein that i keep on closing you cut me open and ikeep bleeding keep keep bleeding love i keep bleeding i keep keep bleeding love keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love you cut me opentrying hard not to hear but they talk so loud their piercing sounds fill my ears try to fill me with doubt yet i know that the goal is to keep me from falling but nothings greater than the rush that comes with your embrace and in this world of loneliness i see your face yet everyone around me thinks that im going crazy maybe maybebut i dont care what they say im in love with you they try to pull me away but they dont know the truth my hearts crippled by the vein that i keep on closing you cut me open and ikeep bleeding keep keep bleeding love i keep bleeding i keep keep bleeding love keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love you cut me openand its draining all of me oh they find it hard to believe ill be wearing these scars for everyone to seei dont care what they say im in love with you they try to pull me away but they dont know the truth my hearts crippled by the vein that i keep on closing you cut me open and ikeep bleeding keep keep bleeding love i keep bleeding i keep keep bleeding love keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love oh you cut me open and ikeep bleeding keep keep bleeding love i keep bleeding i keep keep bleeding love keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love oh you cut me open and ikeep bleeding keep keep bleeding love

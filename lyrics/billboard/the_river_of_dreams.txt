 in the middle of the night i go walking in my sleep from the mountains of faith to a river so deepi must be looking for something something sacred i lost but the river is wide and its too hard to crossand even though i know the river is wide i walk down every evening and i stand on the shore and try to cross to the opposite side so i can finally find out what ive been looking forin the middle of the night i go walking in my sleep through the valley of fear to a river so deepand ive been searching for something taken out of my soul something i would never lose something somebody stolei dont know why i go walking at night but now im tired and i dont want to walk anymore i hope it doesnt take the rest of my life until i find what it is that ive been looking forin the middle of the night i go walking in my sleep through the jungle of doubt to a river so deepi know im searching for something something so undefined that it can only be seen by the eyes of the blindin the middle of the nightim not sure about a life after this god knows ive never been a spiritual man baptized by the fire i wade into the river that runs to the promised landin the middle of the night i go walking in my sleep through the desert of truth to the river so deepwe all end in the ocean we all start in the streams were all carried along by the river of dreamsin the middle of the night

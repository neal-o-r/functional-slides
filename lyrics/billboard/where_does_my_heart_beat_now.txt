 so much to believe in  we were lost in time everything i needed i feel in your eyes always thought of keepin your heart next to mine but now that seems so far away dont know how love could leave without a trace where do silent hearts gowhere does my heart beat now where is the sound that only echoes through the night where does my heart beat now i cant live without without feeling it inside where do all the lonely hearts gocandle in the water  drifting helplessly hiding from the thunder come and rescue me driven by hunger  of the endless dream im searching for the hand that i can hold im reaching for the arms that let me know where do silent hearts gowhere does my heart beat now where is the sound that only echoes through the night where does my heart beat now i cant live without without feeling it inside where do all the lonely hearts gowhere do all the lonely hearts gothen one touch overcomes the silence love still survives two hearts needing one another give me wings to flywhere does my heart beat now where is the sound that only echoes through the night where does my heart beat now i cant live without without feeling it insideive got someone to give my heart to feel it getting stronger and stronger and stronger and i feel inside hearts are made to last till the end of time

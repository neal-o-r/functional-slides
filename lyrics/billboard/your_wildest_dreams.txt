 once upon a time once when you were mine i remember skies reflecting in your eyesi wonder where you are i wonder if you think about me once upon a time in your wildest dreamsonce the world was new our bodies felt the morning dew that greets the brand new day we couldnt tear ourselves awayi wonder if you care i wonder if you still remember once upon a time in your wildest dreamsand when the music plays and when the words are touched with sorrow when the music plays i hear the sound i had to follow once upon a timeonce beneath the stars the universe was ours love was all we knew and all i knew was youi wonder if you know i wonder if you think about it once upon a time in your wildest dreamsand when the music plays and when the words are touched with sorrow when the music plays and when the music plays i hear the sound i had to follow once upon a timeonce upon a time once when you were mine i remember skies mirrored in your eyesi wonder where you are i wonder if you think about me once upon a time in your wildest dreams in your wildest dreams in your wildest dreams in your wildest dreams

 cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights try to keep it clear but im losing it here to the twilight theres a dead end to my left theres a burning bush to my right you arent in sight you arent in sightdo you want me like i want you or am i standing still beneath a darkened sky or am i standing still with the scenery flying by or am i standing still out of the corner of my eye was that you passing me bymothers on the stoop boys in soupedup coupes on this hot summer night between fight and flight is the blind mans sight and a choice thats right i roll the window down feel like im gonna drown in this strange town feel broken down feel broken downdo you need me like i need you or am i standing still beneath a darkened sky or am i standing still with the scenery flying by or am i standing still out of the corner of my eye was that you passing me bysweet sorrow he said call tomorrow sweet sorrow he said call tomorrowdo you love me like i love you or am i standing still beneath a darkened sky or am i standing still with the scenery flying by or am i standing still out of the corner of my eye was that you passing me by are you passing me by passing me by do you want me passing me by do you need me like i need you to and do you want me like i want you are you passing me by or am i standing still

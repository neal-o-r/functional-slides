 those school girl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone but in my mind i know they will still live on and onbut how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume it isnt easy but ill tryif you wanted the sky i would write across the sky in letters that would soar a thousand feet high to sir with lovethe time has come for closing books and long last looks must end and as i leave i know that i am leaving my best frienda friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong thats a lot to learn what can i give you in returnif you wanted the moon i would try to make a star but i would rather you let me give my heart to sir with love

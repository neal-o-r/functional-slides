 life is a moment in space when the dream is gone its a lonelier place i kiss the morning goodbye but down inside you know we never know why the road is narrow and long when eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong i turn away from the wall i stumble and fall but i give you it alli am a woman in love and i do anything to get you into my world and hold you within its a right i defend over and over again what do i dowith you eternally mine in love there is no measure of time we planned it all at the start that you and i live in each others hearts we may be oceans away you feel my love i hear what you say no truth is ever a lie i stumble and fall but i give you it alli am a woman in love and i do anything to get you into my world and hold you within its a right i defend over and over again what do i doi am a woman in love and im talking to you you know i know how it feels what a woman can do its a right i defend over and over againi am a woman in love and i do anything to get you into my world and hold you within its a right i defend over and over again

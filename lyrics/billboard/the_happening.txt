 hey life look at me i can see the reality cause when you shook me took me outta my world i woke up suddenly i just woke up to the happening when you find that you left the future behind cause when you got a tender love you dont take care of then you better beware ofthe happening one day youre up when you turn around you find your world is tumbling down it happened to me and it can happen to youi was sure i felt secure until love took a detour yeah riding high on top of the world it happened suddenly it just happened i saw my dreams torn apart when love walked away from my heart and when you lose a precious love you need to guide you something happens inside youthe happening now i see life for what it is its not of dreams its not of bliss it happened to me and it can happen to you and then it happened oo and then it happened oo and then it happened oo and then it happened

 all of the lonely nights waiting for you to come longing to hold you tight i need you so desperately waiting for you to come bringing your love to me butid wait a million years walk a million miles cry a million tears id swim the deepest sea climb the highest hill just to have you near meas love is reality when you are near to me i am in ecstasy id swallow the pain and pride baby i just cant hide all that i feel inside andid wait a million years walk a million miles cry a million tears id swim the deepest sea climb the highest hill just to have you near mea million years i would cry for you a million tears i would walk for you a million miles i would wait you a million years if you want me topacing the floor detest sweat pouring down my chest still i cant love you less its worth all the pain and pride baby i just cant hide all that i feel inside andid wait a million years walk a million miles cry a million tears id swim the deepest sea climb the highest hill just to have you near me

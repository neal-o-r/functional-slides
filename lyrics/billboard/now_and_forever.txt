 whenever im weary from the battles that rage in my head you make sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread i lose my way but still you seem to understand now and forever i will be your mansometimes i just hold you too caught up in me to see im holding a fortune that heaven has given to me ill try to show you each and every way i can now and forever i will be your mannow i can rest my worries and always be sure that i wont be alone anymore if id only known you were there all the time all this timeuntil the day the ocean doesnt touch the sand now and forever i will be your man now and forever i will be your man

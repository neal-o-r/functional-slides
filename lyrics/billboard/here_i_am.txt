 here i am playing with those memories again and just when i thought time had set me free those thoughts of you keep taunting meholding you a feeling i never outgrew though each and every part of me has tried only you can fill that space insideso theres no sense pretending my heart its not mendingjust when i thought i was over you and just when i thought i could stand on my own oh baby those memories come crashing through and i just cant go on without youon my own ive tried to make the best of it alone ive done everything i can to ease the pain but only you can stop the raini just cant live without you i miss everything about youjust when i thought i was over you and just when i thought i could stand on my own oh baby those memories come crashing through and i just cant go on without go on without its just no good without youwithout you without you without you without you without you without you

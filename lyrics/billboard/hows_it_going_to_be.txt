 im only pretty sure that i cant take anymore before you take a swing i wonder what are we fighting for when i say out loud i want to get out of this i wonder is there anything im going to miss i wonder how its going to be when you dont know me hows it going to be when youre sure im not there hows it going to be when theres no one there to talk to between you and me cause i dont care hows it going to be hows it going to be where we used to laugh theres a shouting match sharp as a thumbnail scratch a silence i cant ignore like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in swings empty dont see lightning like last fall when it was always about to hit me i wonder hows it going to be when it goes down hows it going to be when youre not around hows it going to be when you found out there was nothing between you and me cause i dont care hows it going to be and hows it going to be when you dont know me anymore and hows it going to be want to get myself back in again the soft dive of oblivion i want to taste the salt of your skin the soft dive of oblivion oblivion hows it going to be when you dont know me anymore hows it going to be hows it going to be hows it going to be

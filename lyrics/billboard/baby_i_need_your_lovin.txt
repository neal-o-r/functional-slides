 baby i need your lovin baby i need your lovinalthough youre never near your voice i often hear another day another night i long to hold you tight cause im so lonelychorus baby i need your lovin i got to have all your lovin baby i need your lovin got to have all your lovinsome say its a sign of weakness for a man to beg then weak id rather be if it means havin you to keep cause lately ive been losin sleepchorusempty nights echo your name sometimes i wonder will i ever be the sameoh yeah when you see me smile you know things have gotten worse any smile you might see has all been rehearseddarlin i cant go on without you this emptiness wont let me live without you this loneliness inside me darlin makes me feel not alive honeychorus x2

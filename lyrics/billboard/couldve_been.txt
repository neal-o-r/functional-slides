 the flowers you gave me are just about to die when i think about what couldve been it makes me want to crythe sweet words you whispered didnt mean a thing i guess our song is over as we begin to singcouldve been so beautiful couldve been so right couldve been my lover every day of my life couldve been so beautiful couldve been so right ill never hold what couldve been on a cold and lonely nightthe memorys of our lovin still linger in the air like the faded scent of your roses they stay with me everywhereevery time i get my hopes up they always seem to fall still what couldve been is better than what could never be at allcouldve been so beautiful couldve been so right couldve been my lover every day of my life couldve been so beautiful couldve been so rightyou could love what couldve been on a cold and lonely night

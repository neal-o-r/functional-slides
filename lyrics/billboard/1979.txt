shakedown 1979 cool kids never have the time on a live wire right up off the street you and i should meet june bug skipping like a stone with the headlights pointed at the dawn we were sure wed never see an end to it all and i dont even care to shake these zipper blues and we dont know just where our bones will rest to dust i guess forgotten and absorbed into the earth below double cross the vacant and the bored theyre not sure just what we have in the store morphine city slippin dues down to see we dont even care as restless as we are we feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts and poured cement lamented and assured to the lights and towns below faster than the speed of sound faster than we thought wed go beneath the sound of hope justine never knew the rules hung down with the freaks and the ghouls no apologies ever need be made i know you better than you fake it to see that we dont even care to shake these zipper blues and we dont know just where our bones will rest to dust i guess forgotten and absorbed into the earth below the street heats the urgency of now as you see theres no one around

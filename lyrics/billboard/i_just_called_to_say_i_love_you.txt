 no new years day to celebrate no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away no first of spring no song to sing in fact heres just another ordinary dayno april rain no flowers bloom no wedding saturday within the month of june but what it is is something true made up of these three words that i must say to youi just called to say i love you i just called to say how much i care i just called to say i love you and i mean it from the bottom of my heartno summers high no warm july no harvest moon to light one tender august night no autumn breeze no falling leaves not even time for birds to fly to southern skiesno libra sun no halloween no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring but what it is though old so new to fill your heart like no three words could ever doi just called to say i love you i just called to say how much i care i do i just called to say i love you and i mean it from the bottom of my hearti just called to say i love you i just called to say how much i care i do i just called to say i love you and i mean it from the bottom of my heart of my heart of my heart

 in a little while from now if im not feeling any less sour i promise myself to treat myself and visit a nearby tower and climbing to the top will throw myself off in an effort to make it clear to whoever wants to know what its like when youre shatteredleft standing in the lurch at a church were people saying my god thats tough she stood him up no point in us remaining we may as well go home as i did on my own alone again naturally to think that only yesterdayi was cheerful bright and gay looking forward to who wouldnt do the role i was about to play but as if to knock me down reality came around and without so much as a mere touch cut me into little pieces leaving me to doubt talk about god in his mercyoh if he really does exist why did he desert me in my hour of need i truly am indeed alone again naturally it seems to me that there are more hearts broken in the world that cant be mendedleft unattended what do we do what do we do alone again naturally looking back over the years and whatever else that appears i remember i cried when my father died never wishing to hide the tearsand at sixtyfive years old my mother god rest her soul couldnt understand why the only man she had ever loved had been taken leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken despite encouragement from meno words were ever and when she passed away i cried and cried all day alone again naturally alone again naturally

 night is draggin her feet i wait alone in the heat i know know that you have your way till you have to go home no is a word i cant saycause it gets me nowhere to tell you no and it gets me nowhere to make you go will a little more love make you start depending will a little more love bring a happy ending will a little more love make it right will a little more love make it rightwhere where did my innocence go how how was a young girl to know im trapped trapped in the spell of your eyes in the warmth of your arms in the web of your liesbut it gets me nowhere to tell you no and it gets me nowhere to make you go will a little more love make you start depending will a little more love bring a happy ending will a little more love make it right will a little more love make it rightgets me nowhere to tell you no it gets me nowhere to make you go will a little more love make you start depending will a little more love bring a happy ending will a little more love make it right will a little more love make it rightgets me nowhere to tell you no it gets me nowhere to make you go will a little more love make you start depending will a little more love bring a happy ending will a little more love make it right will a little more love make it rightgets me nowhere to tell you no

 lying beside you here in the dark feeling your heartbeat with mine softly you whisper youre so sincere how could our love be so blind we sailed on together we drifted apart and here you are by my sideso now i come to you with open arms nothing to hide believe what i say so here i am with open arms hoping youll see what your love means to me open armsliving without you living alone this empty house seems so cold wanting to hold you wanting you near how much i wanted you homenow that youve come back turned night into day i need you to stay

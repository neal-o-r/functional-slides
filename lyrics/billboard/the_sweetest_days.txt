 you and i in this moment holding the night so close hanging on still unbroken while outside the thunder rollslisten now you can hear our heartbeat warm against lifes bitter cold these are the days the sweetest days well knowthere are times that scare me were rattle the house like a wind both of ours so unbending we battle the fear withinall the while life is rushing by us hold it now and dont let go these are the days the sweetest days well knowso well whisper a dream here in the darkness watching the stars till theyre gone and when even the memories have all faded away these days go on and onlisten now you can hear our heartbeat hold me now and dont let go these are the days every day is the sweetest day well knowthese are the days the sweetest days well know

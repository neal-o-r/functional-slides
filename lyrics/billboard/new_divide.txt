 i remembered black skies the lightning all around me i remembered each flash as time began to blur like a startling sign that fate had finally found meand your voice was all i heard that i get what i deserveso give me reason to prove me wrong to wash this memory clean let the floods cross the distance in your eyesgive me reason to fill this hole connect the space between let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new dividethere was nothing in sight but memories left abandoned there was nowhere to hide the ashes fell like snow and the ground caved in between where we were standingand your voice was all i heard that i get what i deserveso give me reason to prove me wrong to wash this memory clean let the floods cross the distance in your eyes across this new dividein every loss in every lie in every truth that youd deny and each regret and each goodbye was a mistake to great to hideand your voice was all i heard that i get what i deserveso give me reason to prove me wrong to wash this memory clean let the floods cross the distance in your eyesgive me reason to fill this hole connect the space between let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divideacross this new divide across this new divide

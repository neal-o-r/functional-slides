 the first time ever i saw your face i thought the sun rose in your eyes and the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave to the dark and the endless skies my love to the dark and the endless skiesthe first time ever i kissed your mouth i felt the earth move in my hand like the trembling heart of a captive bird that was there at my command my love that was there at my command my loveand the first time ever i lay with you i felt your heart so close to mine and i knew our joy would fill the earth and last till the end of time my love and it would last till the end of timethe first time ever i saw your face your face your face

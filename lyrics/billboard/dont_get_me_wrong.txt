 dont get me wrong if im looking kind of dazzled i see neon lights whenever you walk bydont get me wrong if you say hello and i take a ride upon a sea where the mystic moon is playing havoc with the tide dont get me wrongdont get me wrong if im acting so distracted im thinking about the fireworks that go off when you smiledont get me wrong if i split like light refracted im only off to wander across a moonlit mileonce in awhile two people meet seemingly for no reason they just pass on the street suddenly thunder showers everywhere who can explain the thunder and rain but theres something in the airdont get me wrong if i come and go like fashion i might be great tomorrow but hopeless yesterdaydont get me wrong if i fall in the mode of passion it might be unbelievable but lets not say so long it might just be fantastic dont get me wrong

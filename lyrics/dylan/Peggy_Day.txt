Peggy Day  stole my poor heart away,
 By golly, what more can I say,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Peggy night makes my future look so bright,
Love to spend the day with Peggy night.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Turned my skies to blue from gray,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.

[spoken: "This is the story about a little girl,
runnin' all over, findin' out all about - life,
She's... goin' out at night, comin home, keepin' late hours,
findin' out all about - just . . . what makes up life.
Eleven years old."]
Little girl, little girl, where you been so long?
Not even your mama knows.
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines.
And I shivered the whole night long.
[harp interlude]
My daddy, he was a railroad man,
Killed a mile and a half from town.
His head, was found neath' the driving wheel
And his body has never been found
You made me love you, four thousand times
And you've taken all the love I had to give.
You've taken my house, you've taken my love.
I'll never love as long as I live.
Little girl, little girl, where you been so long?
Not even your mama knows.
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines.
And I shivered the whole night long.
The longest train I ever seen
was on the Georgia line
The engine fast it seeks a cart,
and it came past by last night
In the pines, in the pines,
where the sun never shines
and I shivered where the cold winds blow
Black girl, black girl,*)             *) [other times it is "dark girl"]
don't you lie to me
tell me where
did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines,
where the sun never shines
I shivered where the cold winds blow.
I asked my captain for the time of day
He got so mad he threw his watch away
The long steel rail that shone 'cross town
I'm on my way back home
In the pines, in the pines,
where the sun never shines
And I shivered where the cold winds blow.
In the pines, in the pines,
where the sun never shines
And I shivered where the cold winds blow.

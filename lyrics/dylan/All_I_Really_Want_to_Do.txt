Chain you down or bring you down

I ain't lookin' to block you up
Shock or knock or lock you up
Analyze you, categorize you
Finalize you or advertise you

I don't want to straight-face you
Race or chase you, track or trace you
Or disgrace you or displace you
Or define you or confine you

I don't want to meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't want to fake you out
Take or shake or forsake you out
I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me
See like me or be like me
Is, baby, be friends with you.

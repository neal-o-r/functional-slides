 Spanish is    the loving tongue
 Soft as music, light as spray
 'Twas a girl    I learned it from
Haven't seen her since that night,
I can't cross the line, you know.
They want me for the gamblin' fight
Like as not it's better so.
 Spanish is the loving tongue
 Soft as music, light as spray
 'Twas a girl I learned it from
On the nights that I would ride
She would listen for my spurs,
Throw that big door open wide,
Raise those laughing eyes of hers.
All 'cause of a stupid gamblin' fight,
And so we said a swift goodbye
On that dark, unlucky night.
Haven't seen her since that night,
I can't cross the line, you know.
Like as not it's better so.
Moonlight on the patio,
Old se√±ora nodding near,
So the Madre couldn't hear.
Oh, how the hours would go a-flyin!
And too soon i'd hear her sighin'
In her little sorry tone
"Adios, mi corazon."
 Spanish is the loving tongue
 Soft as music, light as spray
 'Twas a girl I learned it from
 I don't look much like a lover
 Still I hear her loved words over
 Mostly when I'm all a-lone!

 Oh, how those hours would go a-flyin!
All too soon I would hear her sighin'
In her sweet and quiet tone
  "Mi amor, mi corazon."
 Haven't seen, haven't seen her since that night,
  I can't cross, I can't cross the line, you know.
   They want me for    a gambeling fight
 Like as not it's better so.
 Still I've always  kind of missed her
 Since that last sad night I kissed her
  I broke her heart, left my own
  "Adios,   mi corazon."

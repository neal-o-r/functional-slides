Some red French wine when later wating
In her warm hideaway, she smiled and combed her hair
We talked of all, we talked of nothing
I left with promises to meet; she told me where.
So you may find above the border
A girl with silver rings ...
[sudden stop]
Three silver rings on slim hands waiting
Flash bright in candlelight till Sunday's early morn
We found her room that rainy morning
She took my hand through winding roads and led me home
Some red French wine when later wating
In her warm hideaway, she smiled and combed her hair
We talked of all, we talked of nothing
I left with promises to meet; she told me where.
So you may find above the border
A girl with silver rings, I never knew her name
You're bound to lose, she's too much for you
She'll leave you lost some rainy morn, you won't be the same
you won't be the same

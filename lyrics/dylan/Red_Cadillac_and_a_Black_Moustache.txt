Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
A long tall man with a red coat on
Good-for-nothing-baby you've been doing me wrong
Who you been lovin' since I been gone
Who you been lovin' since I been gone
Who's been playin' around with you?
A real cool cat with eyes of blue
Triflin' baby are you being true?
Who's been fooling around with you?
Who's been fooling around with you?     C7
He held your hand and he sang you a song
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
He held your hand and he sang you a song
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?

Cold black glass don't make no mirror
Cold black water don't make no tears
You say you love me with what may be love
Don't you remember makin' baby love?
Yes, you got your steam drill,
now you're lookin' for some kid
To get it to work for you
like your nine-pound hammer did
But I know that you know that I know that you show
Something is tearing up your mind.
Black sun-glass [came here, pony run] *)
Tombstone babes, y'all can get it done
Fool's gold in your teeth and cementary hips
Get outside of your graveyard lips
Yes, everybody's wonderin'
when your friendship's gonna end
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
And I know that you know that I know that you show
Something is tearing up your mind. **)
Ohh, [you're pleasing?] but your face is red
That ain't he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge
How long's it gonna take for your to get off the edge
You just gonna make everybody jump and roar
Now, whatcha wanna go and do that for?
For I know that you know that I know that you know
Something is tearing up your mind.

And if my love is real
And they, they look at me and frown,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
They don't want me around
They show me to the door,
They say don't come back no more
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to,
A thousand miles from home
Don't let me drift too far,
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed.
And that which you've given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you.
Don't let me change my heart,
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue.
Don't mind the driving rain

You're gonna quit me, baby,
Give you my money, honey,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lawd, Lawd.
You're gonna quit me, baby,
Six months on the chain gang,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lawd, Lawd.
Day you quit me, baby,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lawd, Lawd.
Day you quit me, baby,
[one verse instrumental, then:]

Blue moon you saw me standing alone
 Without a dream in my heart
 Without a love of my own.
Blue moon you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for.
Blue moon now I am no longer alone
Without a dream in may heart
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own.

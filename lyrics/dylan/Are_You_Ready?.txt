Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready to meet Jesus?
Are you where you ought to be?
Are you ready,
hope you're ready.
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren
And to take up my cross?
Or am I still acting like the boss?
When destruction cometh swiftly
And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Have you decided whether you want to be
In heaven or in hell?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Have you got some unfinished business?
Is there something holding you back?
Are you thinking for yourself
Or are you following the pack?
Are you ready for the judgment?
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?
Are you ready for Armageddon?
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?

I'm troubled and I don't know why
the trouble on my mind is driving me blind

Oh, what did the morning say?
Oh, what did the morning say?
Well, it rolled from the night with a dark dreary light
Sayin' another old weary day

Sayin' things ain't goin' so well

and it never said nothing at all
What did the moviescreen lecture?
What did the moviescreen lecture?
Well, it heated and it froze and it took off all its clothes
and I left in the middle of the picture

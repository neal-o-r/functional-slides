Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Hoist the mainsail - here I come
Ain't no room on board for the insincere

Some may sink but we will float
Grab your coat - let's get out of here
You're my witness
I'm your mutineer
I was born to rock the boat
Some may sink but we will float
Grab your coat - let's get out of here
You're my witness
I'm your mutineer
You're my witness
I'm your mutineer

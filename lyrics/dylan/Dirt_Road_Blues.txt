Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone lets me ride
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone lets me ride
I'm gonna run away and hide
Well, I been pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back
pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back
Well, I been praying for salvation
Laying round in a one-room country shack
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed
'Til there's nothing left to see
'Til the chains have been shattered and I been freed
But I'm looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above
looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above
Rolling through the rain and hail
Looking for the sunny side of love
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
I keep on walking
'til I hear her holler out my name
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone lets me ride
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone lets me ride
I'm gonna run away and hide

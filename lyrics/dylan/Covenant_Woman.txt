Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Way up yonder, great will be her reward.
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup.
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Covenant woman, intimate little girl
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world.
You know we are strangers in a land we're passing through.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant too.

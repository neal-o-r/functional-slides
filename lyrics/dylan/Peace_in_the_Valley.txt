Oh well, I'm tired and so weary,
Till the lord comes and takes me away,
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea *)
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lie down by the lamb, oh yes ***)
And the beasts from on wild
they will be lit by a child
And I'll be changed from this creature that I am

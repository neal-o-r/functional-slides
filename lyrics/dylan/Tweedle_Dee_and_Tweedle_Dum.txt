They're throwing knives into the tree
Two big bags of dead man's bones
Got their noses to the grindstone
Trusting their fate to the hands of God
They pass by so silently
Well, they're going to the country, they're going to retire
They're taking a streetcar named Desire
Looking at a window with a pecan pie
Lot of things they'd like they would never buy
Neither one want to turn and run
And making a voyage to the sun.
"His master's voice is calling me,"
All that and more and then some
They walk among the stately trees
They know the secrets of the breeze
"Your presence is obnoxious to me,
Feel like baby sitting on a woman's knee."
Well, the rain beatin' down on a window pane
I got love for you, and it's all in vain
Brains in a pot, they're beginning to boil
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
Tweedle Dee is on his hands and his knees,
Saying, "Throw me something, Mister, please!"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
Well, they're living in a happy harmony
They're one day older and a dollar short
They got a parade permit and a police escort
They're lying low and they're making hay
They seem determined to go all the way
They run a brick and tile company
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
My pretty baby, she's looking around.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
Tweedle Dee is a low-down sorry old man.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
"I've had too much of your company,"

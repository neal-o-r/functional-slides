                          Beyond the . . .
Beyond the horizon,
     behind the sun
At the end of the rainbow, life has only begunIn the long hours of twilight
'neath the stardust above
Beyond the horizon, it is easy to loveBeyond the horizon,
in the springtime or fall
Love waits forever for one and for allBeyond the horizon, across the divide
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
Down in the valley, the water runs cold
Beyond the horizon, someone prayed for your soul
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
Every step that you take, I'm walking the sameBeyond the horizon, the night winds blow
The theme of a melody from many moons ago
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime
Beyond the horizon, I found you just in timeBeyond the horizon, o'er the treacherous sea
I still can't believe that you have set aside your love for meBeyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
In the soft light of morning, I'll follow you with my eyes
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
Beyond the horizon, right down to the bone
Beyond the horizon, the sky is so blue
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you
Beyond the horizon,
     behind the sun
At the end of the rainbow, life has only begunIn the long hours of twilight
'neath the stardust above
Beyond the horizon, it is easy to loveBeyond the horizon,
in the springtime or fall
Love waits forever for one and for all

I get the blues for you baby when I look up at the sun
I get the blues for you baby when I look up at the sun
Come back here we can have some real fun
Well it's early in the evening and everything is still
Well it's early in the evening and everything is still
One more time, I'm walking up on heartbreak hill
Shake, shake mama, like a ship goin' out to sea
Shake, shake mama, like a ship goin' out to sea
You took all my money and you give it to Richard Lee
Down by the river Judge Simpson walkin' around
Down by the river Judge Simpson walkin' around
Nothing shocks me more than that old clown
Some of you women you really know your stuff
Some of you women you really know your stuff
But your clothes are all torn and your language is a little too rough
Shake, shake mama, shake it 'til the break of day
Shake, shake mama, shake it 'til the break of day
I'm right here baby, I'm not that far away
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
Shake, shake mama, raise your voice and pray
Shake, shake mama, raise your voice and pray
If you're goin' on home, better go the shortest way

Well there's one kind-a favor I'll ask of you
Well there's one kind-a favor I'll ask of you
There's just one kind favor I'll ask of you
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
And there's two white horses following me
And there's two white horses following me
      D         /c     /b         (5th str: 0h2)
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on    my burying ground.
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Means another poor boy is underground.
Did you ever hear them church bells tone
Have you ever hear that church bells tone
Did you ever hear them church bells tone
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
Now I believe what the bible told.
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean.

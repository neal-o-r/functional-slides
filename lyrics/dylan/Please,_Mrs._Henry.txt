Well, I've already had two beers
I'm ready for the broom
Take me to my room?
I'm a good ol' boy
But I've been sniffin' too many eggs
Talkin' to too many people
Drinkin' too many kegs
Well, I'm groanin' in a hallway
Take me to your dad?
I can drink like a fish
I can crawl like a snake
I can bite like a turkey
I can slam like a drake
Now, don't crowd me, lady
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy
I'm a thousand years old
I'm T-boned and punctured
Now, I'm startin' to drain
My stool's gonna squeak
If I walk too much farther
My crane's gonna leak
There's only so much I can do
Why don't you look my way
An' pump me a few?

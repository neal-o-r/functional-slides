Ev'rybody's building the big ships and the boats,
Some are building monuments,
Others are jotting down notes,
Ev'rybody's in despair,
Ev'ry girl and boy
Ev'rybody's [gonna] jump for joy.
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I likes my sugar sweet,
But guarding fumes and making haste, *)
It ain't my cup of meat.
Ev'rybody's just standin' round 'neath the trees,
Feeding pigeons on a limb
them pigeons'll go to him.
A lamp gate, a gunny dew, I can't recite them all **)
Just tell me where it hurts ***)
And I'll tell you who to call
Nobody can get no sleep,
There's someone on ev'ryone's toes
Ev'rybody's gonna doze.

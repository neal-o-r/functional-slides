The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by ban - dits
I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles
the music play slow
The night is on fire
There is no use in talkin'
and there's no need for blame
There is nothing to prove,
Ev'rything still is the same
A table stands empty
By the edge of the stream
The sky's changing colours
The jacks and the queens
they forsake the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies
Now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce
And the ace once ran wild
The sky is folding
I'll see you after a while.
See the cross-eyed pirates sit
Perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans
With a sawed-off shotgun
And the corporals and neighbors
clap and cheer with each blast
The sky it is trembling
In the rooftoops they dance
Valentino-type tangos
While the hero's clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead
Not to embarrass anyone
The sky is flooding over
The camouflaged parrot
He flutters from fear
when something he doesn't know about
suddenly appears
What cannot be imitated
perfect must die
The sky's flooding over
and I must go where it is dry
Machine guns are roaring
Puppets heave rocks
At misunderstood visions
and at the faces of clocks
Call me any name you like
I will never deny it
The sky is erupting
And I must go where it's quiet.

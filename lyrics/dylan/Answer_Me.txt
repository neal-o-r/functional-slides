Answer me, oh my love
Just what sin have I been guilty of
Won't you tell me  how I lost your love
Answer me, sweetheart.
You were mine yesterday
I thought love was here tot stay
Won't you tell where I've gone astray,
Answer me my love
won't you say we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Answer me my love

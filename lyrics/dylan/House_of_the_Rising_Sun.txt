they call the rising sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
My mother was a tailor,
she sowed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord,
Now the only thing a gambler needs
is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time when he's satisfied
is when he's on a drunk.
He fills his glasses up to the brim
and he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
is rambling from town to town.
Oh tell my baby sister
not to do what I have done
they call the rising sun.
Well with one foot on the platform
and the other foot on the train
to wear that ball and chain.
my race is almost run
I'm going back to end my life
down in the rising sun.

If I had listened to what my momma said,
I'd-a been at home today
But being so young and foolish,
I let gambling lead me astray.

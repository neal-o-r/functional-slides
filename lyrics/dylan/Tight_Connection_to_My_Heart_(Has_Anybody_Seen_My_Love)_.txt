You got a Tight connection to my heart
You got a Tight connection to my heart
You got a Tight connection to my heart
You got a Tight connection to my heart
And I couldn't with you around my neck.
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven't even started yet.
I'll go along with this charade
Until I can think my way out.
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about.
 Someday maybe
I'll remember to forget.
I'm gonna get my coat,
I feel the breath of a storm.
There's something I've got to do tonight,
You go inside and stay warm.
You want to talk to me,
Go ahead and talk.
Whatever you got to say to me
Won't come as any shock.
I must be guilty of something,
You just whisper it into my ear.
She lulled me to sleep,
In a town without pity
Where the water runs deep.
She said, "Be easy, baby,
There ain't nothin' worth stealin' in here."
You're the one I've been looking for,
You're the one that's got the key.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you
Or you're too good for me.
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight
And there's no moon.
There's just a hot-blooded singer
While they're beatin' the devil out of a guy
Who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Later he'll be shot
For resisting arrest,
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness.
What looks large from a distance,
Close up ain't never that big.
Never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine,
Never could learn to hold you, love,
And call you mine.
And I couldn't with you around my neck.
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven't even started yet.
I'll go along with this charade
Until I can think my way out.
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about.
 Someday maybe
I'll remember to forget.
I'm gonna get my coat,
I feel the breath of a storm.

Until I can think my way out.
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about.
 Someday maybe
I'll remember to forget.
I'm gonna get my coat,
I feel the touch of a storm.
There's something I've got to do tonight,
You go inside and stay warm.
They say "eat, drink and be merry, Take the bull by the horns."
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns
Everything looks   a little far away to me
Gettin' harder and harder to recognize the trap
Too much information about nothin', Too much educated rap
just like you told me, It's just like you said it would be
The moon goin' up like wildfire
I feel the breath of a storm.
Something I got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm.
Just got back from a city of powder blue skies
Everybody thinks with their stomach
There's plenty of spies
Every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear
Madame Butterfly, she lulls me to sleep
Like an ancient river
So wide and deep
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothin' worth stealin' here"
You're the one I've been waitin' for
But you must first realize
I'm not another man for hire
I hear the hot-blooded singer
On the bandstand croon
While they're beating the devil out of a guy
who's wearing a flaming red wig
I gotta confess
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness
What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.

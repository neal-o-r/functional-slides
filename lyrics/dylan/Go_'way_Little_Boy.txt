Go 'way little boy
I'm not for you
Go back to her
Where you'll be more secure
She knows you much better than I do
Go 'way little boy
I'm not for you
Go 'way little boy
You're making me sad
I don't wanna see you bleed
She's the one that you need
You'll never miss what you ain't never had
Go 'way little boy
You're making me sad
Go way little boy
It's much too late
Walk back out the door
Dont wanna see you no more
You're making it hard for me to concentrate
Go 'way little boy
It's much too late
Go way little boy
You're much too late
Your future's bright
Dont throw it away tonight
It's getting hard for me to look you in the eye
Go 'way little boy
you're makin' me cry

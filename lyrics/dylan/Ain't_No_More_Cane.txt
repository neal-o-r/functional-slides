Ain't no more cane on the Brazos
Its done ground all to molasses
Shoulda been on the river in 1910
They were driving the women just like men.
Shoulda been on the river in 1905
Find yourself lucky to be alive
Go down Old Hannah, don't you rise no more
Ain't no more cane on the Brazos
They've done ground it all to molasses

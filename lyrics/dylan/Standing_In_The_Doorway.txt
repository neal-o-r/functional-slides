 I'm walkin' through      the summer nights
the jukebox playing low
yesterday everything    was goin' too fast
Today   it's movin' too slow
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standing in the doorway cryin'
I got nothin' to go back to now.
The light in this place is so bad
Makin' me sick in the head
All the laughter is just makin' me sad
The stars have turned cherry red
   I'm strummin' on my gay guitar
   Smokin' a cheap cigar
The ghost of our old love has not gone away
Don't look it like it will anytime soon
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Under the midnight moon.
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things I could say, but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near
   I been ridin a midnight train
   Got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against every rule
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Sufferin' like a fool.
When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy you'll roll no more
I can hear the church bells ringin' in the yard
I wonder who they're ringin' for
   But my heart just won't give in
Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
In the dark land of the sun.
I eat when I'm hungry drink when I'm dry
And live my life on the square
And even if the flesh falls off of my face
I know someone will be there to care
   It always means so much
   Even the softest touch
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
There's no words that need to be said
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Blues wrapped around my head.
 I'm walkin' through        the summer nights
jukebox    playing low
 yesterday           everything was movin' too fast
 Today      it's moving, moving too slow
 I don't know if I saw you        if I would kiss you or kill you
 It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standing,    standing in the doorway cryin'
 Ah, well, I got nothin' to go back to     now.

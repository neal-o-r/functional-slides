 You speak to me   in sign language
As I'm eatin' a sandwich in a small cafe
 At a quarter to three.
But I can't respond to your sign language.
You're taking advantage, bringing me down
Can't you make any sound?
'Twas there by the bakery, surrounded by fakery
Tell her my story, still I'm still there
Does she know I still care?
Link Wray was playin' on a jukebox I was payin'
For the words I was sayin' so misunderstood
He didn't do me no good.
You speak to me in sign language
As I'm eatin' a sandwich in a small cafe
At a quarter to three.
But I can't respond to your sign language.
You're taking advantage, bringing me down
Can't you make any sound?

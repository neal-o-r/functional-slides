Behind the Louisiana line
Get me a fortune tellin' woman
One that's gonna read my mind
Take the right hand road
Take the right hand road
Those western Dallas streets, boys
They' bound ta kill ya fo' sho'
Eh they's stars up above
Lord it's my a-leavin' m' sign
Well you never miss your water
'till the well runs dry
An' you never miss your water
'Till the well runs dry
An' you never miss your man
'till he says "Good-bye"
You can write an' tell m' Mama
I won't be comin' home tonight
You can write an' tell my Mother
I won't be home tonight

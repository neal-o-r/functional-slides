Come you phoney super-patriotic people that say
That hating and fearing is my only way
That this here country has got to be
You're thinking of yourselves, you ain't thinking of me.
You're not thinking of any George Washington
You're not thinking of any Thomas Jefferson
But you say that you are and you lie and mislead
You use their names for your aims, for your selfish greed.
Don't speak to me of your patriotism
When you throw the Southern black boy in prison
And you say the only good niggers are the ones that have died
      /g-bb       /g         /f /d   G
Don't think I'll  ever stand on your side.
Though you make it so hard for me to love
My face will never feel the slap of your glove
My hands will never buy the cards that you play
   /g-bb           /g-bb     /g  /f        /d  G
My feet will never walk down the road that you lay.
Get out in the open, stop standing afar
Let the whole world see what a hypocrite you are
I ain't joking and it ain't no gag
You bin hiding too long behind the American flag.

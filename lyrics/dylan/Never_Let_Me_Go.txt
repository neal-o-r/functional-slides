Just let me love you tonight
    Forget about tomorrow
    My darlin' let me hold you tight
And never let me go
Dry your eyes
No tears and no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might
And never let me go
Give me the right
In summer or in spring-time
To tell the world that you are mine
And never let me go.

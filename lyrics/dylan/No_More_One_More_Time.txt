I should have done what I'm gonna do a long time ago                  |-----------------|
Given you up, as you got me down to an all time low                   |-----------------|
I've been a fool, but beeing a fool, I fell in love with your kind    |-----------------|
I'm gonna try something new to get over you this time
I'd like to say, but I can't say that it's been fun
You had my heart locked away in the dark and it could use some sun
I'm gonna miss you a lot, honey I got to let you go
So go ahead and try, you might even cry, you never know

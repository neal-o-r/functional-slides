Down the street the dogs are barking
And the day is a-getting dark.
As the night comes in a-fallin'
The dogs, they'll lose their bark.
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.
From the crossroads of my doorstep,
My eyes start to fade.
And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid.
And I gaze back to the street
the sidewalk and the sign.
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.
It's a restless, hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good.
When everything I'm saying,
You can say it just as good.
You are right from your side,
We're both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.
Down the street the dogs are barking
And the day is getting dark.
As the night comes in a-fallin'
The dogs, they'll lose their bark.
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
As I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand mi  -   les behind.
Down the street the dogs are barking
And the day is getting dark.
As the night comes in a-fallin'
The dogs, they'll lose their bark.
The silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
As I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles
behind.
Down the street the dogs are barking
And the day is getting dark.
As the night comes in a-fallin'
The dogs, they'll lose their bark.
The silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
As I leave one too many mornings
And a thousand miles  behind.
. . .
I've no right to be here
If you've no right to stay
Until we're both one too many mornings
And a thousand miles away

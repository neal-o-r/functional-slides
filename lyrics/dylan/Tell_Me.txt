Tell me, I've got to know.
Tell me, tell me before I go.
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Tell me, will it come to me after you're gone? *)
Tell me, are those rock 'n' roll dreams in your eyes?
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Tell me,    will it come to me after you're gone?

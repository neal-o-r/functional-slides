Man, that weeping willow, moaning like a dove
Weeping willow moaning like a dove
Man, there's a gal up the country I sure do love
If you see my baby tell her to hurry home
You see my baby, tell her hurry home
I ain't had no lovin' since my little girl been gone
Where it ain't no love, ain't no gettin' along, (aaaww, shucks!)
ain't no love, mama, ain't no love and gettin' along.
My baby treats me so mean and dirty, can't tell right from wrong
Gonna buy me a bulldog, watch you while you sleep
Buy me a bulldog, watch you while you sleep
I have to stop them men from makin' early mornin' creep.
You gonna want my love, mama, some old lonesome day,
You gonna want my love, mama, some old lonesome day,
But it'll be too late, I'll be gone too far away.
Oh, that weeping willow, mourning like a dove
Weeping willow mourning like a dove
Well, there's a gal in the country man I sure do love.

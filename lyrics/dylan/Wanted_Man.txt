Wanted man in California, wanted man in Buffalo,
wanted man in Kansas City, wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in old Cheyenne,
wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man
I might be in Colorado, or Georgia by the sea,
workin' for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me comin', and if you know who I am,
don't you breath it to nobody 'cos you know I'm on the lamb
wanted man by Nelly Johnson, wanted man in this Tex town
Well, I've had all that I wanted of a lot of things I had,
and a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad.
I got sidetracked in El Paso, stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Pleura with Juanita on my back
Wonderin' why I'm wanted at some town half way between
Wanted man in Albuquerque, Wanted man in Syracuse
There's somebody set to grab me anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight you might get a glimpse of me
Wanted man in California, wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in ol' Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man

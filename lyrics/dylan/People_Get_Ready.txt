People get ready, there's a train a comin'
picking up passengers coast to coast
All you need is faith to hear the diesels a-hummin'
[...] among the loved the most.
People get ready for that train to Jordan
picking up passengers [...]
All you need is faith to hear those diesels a-hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord
There ain't no roomfor the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances get slimmer
For there's no hiding place among the Kingdom's throne
So people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels a-hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord
[D: "remember this one"]

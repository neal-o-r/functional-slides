Well, I walked all night long
Hearin' them church bells toll
Yes, I walked all night long
Listening to them church bells toll
Either someone needing mercy
 might be somethin' I've done wrong.
Well, your friends come by for you
I don't know what to say
Well, your friends come by for you
I don't know what to say
I just can't face to tell 'em
Honey you just went away.
The children cry for mother
I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip.”
Well, the children cry for mother
I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip.”
Well, I walk on pins and needles
I hope my tongue don't slip.
Well, I gaze at passing strangers
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers
But the sun goes around the heavens
And another day just drives on through.
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
But that's all right, baby
You know I always understand.
Call girls in the doorway
All givin' me the eye
Call girls in the doorway
All givin' me the eye
But my heart's just not in it
I might as well pass right on by.
My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
Well, it can't be no guitar player
It must be combat bells.

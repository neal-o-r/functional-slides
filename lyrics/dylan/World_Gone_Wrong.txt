Strange things have happened like never before
My baby told me I would have to go
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
No use in worrying cause the world gone wrong
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
I told you baby, right to your head
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, cause the world gone wrong.
I tried to be lovin', and treat you kind
But it seem like you never right, you got no loyal mind
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, cause the world's gone wrong.
If you had a woman and she don't treat you kind
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Said, when you been good now, can't do no more
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door"
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
No use to ask me baby, cause I'll never be back
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good baby.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.

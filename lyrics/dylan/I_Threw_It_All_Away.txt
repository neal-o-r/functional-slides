I once held her in my arms,
She said she would always stay.
I treated her like a fool,
    I threw it all away.
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.
I must have been mad,
Until I threw it all away.
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,
For one thing that's certain,
You will surely be a-hurtin',
If you throw it all away
If you throw it all away.
[Ending same as intro]
I once held her in my arms.
She said she would always stay.
But I must have been mad, never knew what I had.
      I threw it all away
      I threw it all away
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hands.
And rivers that ran through every day.
But what did I do?  I let it all slip through.
I threw it all away.
I threw it all away.
So if you find someone who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
One thing's for sure, there ain't no cure
If you throw it all away.
If you throw it all away.

I've got a wife and five little children
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan
Ain't nothin' to do
But to sit down and sing
Whistle done blows and the fiddler squalls
Captain gone through the hole-in-the-wall
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing
Yankee built boats to shoot them Rebels
My gun's steady gonna hold it level
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing
I've got a wife and five little children
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan
Ain't nothin' to do
But to set down and sing

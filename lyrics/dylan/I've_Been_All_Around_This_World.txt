Rifle on my shoulder, six-shooter in my hand
Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world.
Hattie, oh Hattie, come out and by the door
Hattie, oh Hattie, come out, come out and by the door
'Fore I have to step in with my .44.
God knows, I been all around this world
Hang me, oh hang me, I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh hang me, I'll be dead and gone
wouldn't mind your hanging boy, but your jailing takes too long  [/wait in jail so long]
Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world
Rifle on my shoulder, six-shooter in my hand
Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world

Soon [all the] nights they will be ended,
Soon, all true love will be so splen-did.
 I've found the happiness I've waited for.
 The only girl that I was waiting for.
Oh, soon a little cabin there will find us,
Safe all our cares so far behind  us
 When you are mine this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon.
Let's make that day come soon.
Soon the lonely nights will be ended,
Soon, two hearts as one will be blended.
I've found the happiness I've waited for.
The only girl that I was fated for.
Oh, soon a little cottage will find us
Safe with all our cares far behind us
The day your mine this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon.

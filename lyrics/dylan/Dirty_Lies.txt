Sometime she said  I'm slow
 She said it about me but it's too soon to know
Don't mind leaving, wondering why
Whosoever told it, told a dirty lie
Well, I'll tell you one more to
Take what is you with you when you go
Now I'll tumble, tumble and die
Whosoever told it, told a dirty lie
I'll love it and leave it, the sun go down
Pray for the rain for miles around
I'll never leave it to wonder why
Whosoever told you, told a dirty lie
[instrumental verses]
I want to leave, my feet's soaking wet
I long to leave but I ain't found you yet
And I know baby, telling you why
Whosoever told me, told a dirty lie

If you'll gather 'round me, people,
Oklahoma knew him well.
It was in the town of Shawnee,
On a Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in a wagon
And into town they rode.
There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Using vulgar words of language,
An' his wife she overheard.
Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.
Now he took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame;
Was added to his name.
He took to the trees and timber
On the Canadian river shore,
At every farmer's door.
Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
And underneath the napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say:
You say that I'm an outlaw,
Well, here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.
Well, as through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen.
But as through this world you ramble,
As through this world you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.

What was it you wanted
Tell me again so I'll know
What's happening in there,
What's going on in your show
What was it you wanted
Could you say it again?
I'll be back in a minute
You can get it together by then.
What was it you wanted
We can start it all over
Get it back on the track
You got my attention
Go ahead speak
What was it you wanted
When you were kissing my cheek?
Was there somebody looking
When you gave me that kiss
Someone there in the shadows
Someone that I might have missed?
Is there something you needed
Something I don't understand.
What was it you wanted.
Do I have it here in my hand?
What was it you wanted,
I ain't keeping score
Are you the same person
That was here before?
Is it something important
What was it you wanted?
Is the scenery changing,
Is the whole thing going backwards
Are they playing our song?
Where were you when it started
Do you want it for free
What was it you wanted
Are you talking to me?

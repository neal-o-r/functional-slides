Some old lady, in this town.
Keeps telling all them lies on me.
Wish to my soul that old lady would die.
Stop telling all them lies on me.
Oh babe, it ain't no lie.
Oh babe, it ain't no lie.
Oh babe, it ain't no lie.
this life I lead is mighty high.
Been all around this whole wide world
Honey babe I just got back today
I've been saving all of my love for you
Honey baby what more can I do
Oh babe, it ain't no lie (etc.)

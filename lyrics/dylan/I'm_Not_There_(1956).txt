Well it's alright
she'nay she's all the time in my
neighborhood
she cried both day and night,
I know it because it was there.
It's a milestone
but she's down on her luck,
and she daily salutin
but to make him hard to buck,
I don't belong to anybody,
she's my prize forsaken angel
but she don't hear me cry.
She's a long-hearted mystic
and she can't carry on,
when I'm there she's alright,
but she's not, when I'm gone
like I cried the night before,
and I'm knees on the hassle,
but I dream about the door.
blind fate, with a tell,
it don't hang contonation
she's my ald fare-thee-well.
Well it's all about deffusion
I don't need anybody now
beside me to tell
And it's all affirmation
I recieve, but it's not,
She's a lone-hearted beauty
but she's gone like the spot
if she waoun...
Well it's a too hard to stake-in,
and I don't bart-b'lieve
It's all bag for tebusing,
but she's hard, too hard to leave.
It's alone, it's a crime
the way she moult me around
was she told for to hate me
by this dong fortaken clown.

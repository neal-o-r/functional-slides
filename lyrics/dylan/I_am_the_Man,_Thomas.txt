They drove me up the hill, Thomas
They made me carry the cross, Thomas
They crowned my head with thorns, Thomas
They nailed me to the cross, Thomas
They pierced me in the side
I died on the cross, Thomas
They buried me in the tomb, Thomas
They pierced my side with thorns, Thomas
They made me carry the cross, Thomas
They drove me off a cliff, Thomas

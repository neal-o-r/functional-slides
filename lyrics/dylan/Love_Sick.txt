I'm walking,
through streets that are dead
walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired
My brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping
hear someone tell a lie
hear someone's distant cry
I spoke like a child
You destroyed me with a smile
while i was sleeping
    I'm sick of love*)
That I'm in the thick of it
    This kind of love
I'm so sick of it
I see lovers in the meadow
I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them 'til they're gone
and they leave me hangin' on
to a shadow
I'm sick of love
I hear the clock tick
this kind of love
I'm lovesick
the silence can be like thunder
I wanna take to the road of plunder
Could you ever be true?
I think of you and I wonder
I'm sick of love
I'm sick of love
I'm tryin' to forget you
Just don't know what to do
I'd give anything to be with you

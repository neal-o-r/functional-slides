Makes a long time man   feel bad
Makes a long time man   feel bad
When you're out all alone
No letter from your home
Makes a long time man feel bad
I believe my dear old mother's gone
I believe my dear old mother's gone
I believe she's gone on to a better land
It makes a long time man feel bad
Go tell all my friends goodbye
You can tell all my friends so long
You can tell my friends so long,
I'll see you next time around
It makes a long time man feel bad
It makes a long time man feel bad
It makes a long time man feel bad
When you're out all alone
and you get no letter from your home
It makes a long time man feel bad

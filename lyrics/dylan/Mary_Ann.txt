Oh fare thee well my own true love
Fare thee well but for a while
The ship is waitin' an' the wind blows high
An' I am bound away for the sea,
    (I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann)
Ten thousand miles away from home
Ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze an' the earth may burn
If I never no more return to you,
Oh don't you see that crow fly high
She'll surely turn to white
If ever I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear
Oh, if I had a flask of gin an' sugar here for two
An' a great big bowl for to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear
Yes I'd pour a drink for you, my dear

[instr. verse]
 All ye brave huntsmen   who follow the gun
 Beware of a-shooting at the setting of the sun
For her true love went a-huntin' and he   shot in the dark
But oh and alas Polly Vaughn was his mark.
He ran up beside her when he found it was she
His legs they grew weak and his eyes could not see
He embraced her in his arms when he found she was dead
And a fountain of tears for his true love he shed
He took her in his arms and home ran he
Crying: "Father, dear father, I've shot fair Polly
I've shot that fair female in the bloom of her life
And I always intended to make her my wife
Midnight, in his chamber, Polly Vaughn did appear
Crying: "Jimmy oh Jimmy you have nothing to fear
Stay in your country till your trial comes on
you shall not be convicted for what you have done
In the midst of his trial Polly Vaughn did appear
The judge and the lawyers stood around in a row
Polly Vaughn in the middle like a fountain of snow

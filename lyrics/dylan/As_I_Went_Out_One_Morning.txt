To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains.
I offer'd her my hand,
She took me by the arm.
I knew that very instant,
She meant to do me harm.
[Harmonica as intro]
"Depart from me this moment,"
I told her with my voice.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth,
"I will secretly accept you
And together we'll fly south."
Came running from across the field,
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield.
And as she was letting go her grip,
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me,
"I'm sorry for what she's done."

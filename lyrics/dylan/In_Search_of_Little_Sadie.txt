Went out last night just to take a little round.
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head.
I began to think what a deed I'd done.
I grabbed my hat and I began to run.
I made a god run but I ran too slow;
They overtook me down in Jericho
Standing on a corner I's ringin' my bell,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.
He says 'Young man is your name Brown?
Remember you blowed Sadie down."
[from this point there is some kind of regular rhythm]
"Oh yes sir, my name is Lee.
  I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.
  First degree and second degree.
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?"
Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black,
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
I had no one for to go my bail;
They crammed me back into the county jail.
Oh, yes they did.
Now, the judge and the jury they took their stand.
The judge had the papers in his right hand.
Forty-one days, forty-one nights;
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes;
Went out last night to take a little round.
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down.
I ran right home and I went to bed,
A forty-four smokeless under my head.

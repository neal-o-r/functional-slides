Get you a copper kettle,   get you a copper coil,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil.
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak,
Don't use no green or rotten wood; they'll get you by the smoke.
My daddy, he made whiskey; my granddaddy, he did too.
 We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.

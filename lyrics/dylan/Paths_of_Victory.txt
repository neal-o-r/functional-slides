The trail is dark and dusty
The road is kind of rough,
But the good road is a-waiting
And boys it ain't far off.
Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.
I walked down to the valley,
I turned my head up high.
I seen that silver linin'
That was hangin' in the sky.
Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.
The evenin' dust was rollin',
I was walking down the track.
There was a one-way wind a-blowin'
it was blowin' at my back.
Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.
The gravel road is bumpy,
It's a hard old road to ride,
But the clearer road's up yonder
With the cinders on the side.
Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.
Tha mornin' train was movin',
The hummin' of its wheels,
told me of a new day
comin' across the field.
Trails of troubles,
Roads of battles,
Paths of victory,
We shall walk.

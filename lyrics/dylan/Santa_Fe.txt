dear dear dear dear dear Sante Fe
My woman needs every day
She promised to let me stay
She's rollin' up a knot to pray to gods away
Now she opens up and lets me home
She's brown but she keeps from roam
She'll open up a happy home
She'll think when will that be warm in Sante Fe.
She's arms never teach to roam
They're never never far from home
I'll never ever ever roam
She's all feel bad
No no no no don't don't don't feel bad
She's the worst thing he's ever had
She's a mad, man that he's so glad
She's over above the hat to bad
She's never disappear so bad
My own heart city lay
I won't have a nature way
And I'm leavin' every day to run away
My woman's left sittin' at home
She's actin' the police unknown
She cried like an evening stone
She leap back under a broom
But she ain't gonna find a room
And the tears send her on own ever day.

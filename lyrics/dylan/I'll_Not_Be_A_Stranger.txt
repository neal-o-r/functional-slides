I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city;
I'm acquainted with folks over there.
There'll be friends there to greet me,
There'll be loved ones to meet me
At the gates of that city four square.
I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city;
I've a home on the streets paved with gold.
I'll feel right at home there
In that beautiful somewhere
With the loved ones whose memory I hold.
I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city;
There'll be no lonely days over there.
There'll be no stormy weather
But a great time together
On the streets of that city four square.

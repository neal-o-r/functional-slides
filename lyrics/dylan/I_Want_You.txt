The guilty undertaker sighs,
The lonesome organ grinder cries,
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn,
But it's not that way,
I wasn't born to lose you.
I want you so bad,
The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep,
They wait for you.
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin' from my broken cup
Open up the gate for you.
I want you so bad,
And talk with my chambermaid.
She knows that I'm not afraid
To look at her.
She is good to me
And there's nothing she doesn't see.
She knows where I'd like to be
But it doesn't matter.
I want you so bad,
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
He spoke to me, I took his flute.
No, I wasn't very cute to him,
But I did it, though, because he lied
Because he took you for a ride
And because time was on his side
I want you so bad,
 The guilty undertaker sighs,
                           /b
The lonesome organ grinder cries,
The silver saxophones say I
should refuse you.
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
                       /b
Blow into my face with scorn,
But it's not that way, I wasn't born
to lose you.
I   want you so bad,

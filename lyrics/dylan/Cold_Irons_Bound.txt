I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around
now I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
and my love for her is taking such a long time to die
Lord I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist
It's almost like, almost like I don't exist
I'm 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
The walls of pride is high and wide,
can't see over to the other side
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
it's sadder still to feel your heart torn away
one look at you and I'm out of control
like the universe has swallowed me whole
I'm 20 miles out of town and Cold Irons bound
There's too many people, too many to recall
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine
I was wrong about 'em all
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
I found my world, I found my world in you
but your love just hasn't proved true
I'm 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
 ...
Well the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
reality has always had too many heads
some things last longer than you think they will
there are some kind of things you can never kill
it's you and you only I'm thinking about
but you can't see in, and it's hard looking out
I'm 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
Well the fat's in the fire, and the water's in the tank
and the whiskey's in the jar, and the money's in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
I'm gonna remember forever the joy we've shared
but looking at you and I'm on my bended knee
you have no idea what you do to me
I'm 20 miles out of town Cold Irons bound
20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around
now I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
and my love for her is taking such a long time to die
Lord I'm waist deep,     waist deep in the mist
It's almost like        I don't even exist
I'm 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around
now I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
and my love for her is taking such a long time to die
Lord I'm waist deep,     waist deep in the mist
It's almost like        I don't even exist
I'm 20 miles out of town, Cold Irons bound

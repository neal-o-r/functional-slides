[it's] alright in my head, but I can't slumber
and its too high for me to count, I can't get the number
I'm a fool for you
yes I'm a fool for you
Well, you hear my celebrate, oh its story
but they're all too vain for me, all they want is glory
I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
It's crazy down in love ridin' all around
it's the rain it come down like a me it's underground
I'm a fool for you
yeah I'm a fool for you
when I come back when I don't make my return
yeah the heart shall rise, everybody shall burn
yes, I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you

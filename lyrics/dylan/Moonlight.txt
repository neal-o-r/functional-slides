The seasons, they are turning
And my sad heart is yearning                        :     .      :     .

out in the moonlight alone
The dusky light the day is losing
Orchids, poppies, black-eyed susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Won't you meet me
out in the moonlight alone
The air is thick and heavy
All along the levee
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Won't you meet me
out in the moonlight alone
The clouds are turning crimson
The leaves fall from the limbs and
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Won't you meet me
out in the moonlight alone
The boulevards of cypress trees
The masquerade of birds and bees
The petals pink and white, the wind has blown
Won't you meet me
out in the moonlight alone
Old pulses running through my palm
The sharp hills are rising from
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
Won't you meet me
out in the moonlight alone
[instr. verse, ending with:]
The trailing moss and mystic glow
Purple blossoms soft as snow
My tears keep flowing without end
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
It takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you, my friend

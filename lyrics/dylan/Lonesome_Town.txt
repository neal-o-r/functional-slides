There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away,
And they call it lonesome town,
Where the broken hearts stay.
You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years,
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears.
There's a place of broken dreams
Every streets is filled with regret.
Maybe down in lonesome town
I can learn to forget.

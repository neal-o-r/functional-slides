Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I'd let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully
But the bottles are done, we've killed each one
And the table is full and overflowed
And the corner sign says it's closing time
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road
Oh every girl that ever I've touched
I did not do it harmfully
And every girl that ever I've hurt
I did not do it knowingly
But to remain as friends, you need the time
To make amends and stay behind
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past
I'll bid farewell and be down the line
Oh every foe that ever I faced
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame
But the dark does die as the curtain is drawn
And somebody's eyes must meet the dawn
And if I see the day I'd only have to stay
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone
Oh every thought that strung a knot in my mind
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung
But it's not to stand naked under unknown (unknowin'?) eyes
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung
But the time ain't tall if on time you depend
And no word is possessed by no special friend
And though the line is cut it ain't quite the end
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again
Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me
But if the arrow is straight and the point is slick
It can pierce through the dust no matter how thick
So I'll make my stand and remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn
All the money that in my life I did spend
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I'd let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully
But the bottles are done, we've killed each one
And the table is full and overflowed
And the corner sign says it's closing time
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road

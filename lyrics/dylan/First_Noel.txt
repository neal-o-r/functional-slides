The first Noel the angels did sing
Was to certain poor shepherds In fields as they lay
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
[They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night]
And by the light of that same star
three wise men came from country far
to seek for a king was their intent
and to follow the star wherever it went.

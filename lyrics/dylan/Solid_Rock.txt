to a solid rock
before
the foundation
of
the world
And I won't let go, and I can't let go, won't let go
And I can't let go, won't let go, and I can't let go no more.
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
For me he was rejected by a world that He created.
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
People are expecting a false peace to come.
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
Using all the devices under the sun.
And He never give up 'til the battle's lost or won.

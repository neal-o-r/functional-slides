If you had not have fallen then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
I patched up your broken wing and hung around for a while
trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
I knew someday that you would fly away
for love's the greatest healer to be found
Fly on fly on past the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up than see you down

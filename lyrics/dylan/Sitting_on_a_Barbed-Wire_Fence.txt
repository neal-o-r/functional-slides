I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents
See my bull dog bite a rabbit
And my hound dog is sittin' on a barbed-wire fence
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot
But he wouldn't tell me what it was that I got
Well, this woman I've got, she's killin' me alive
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killin' me alive
She's makin' me into an old man,
and man I'm not even 25
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Unless you've been inside a tunnel
And fell down 69, 70 feet over a barbed-wire fence

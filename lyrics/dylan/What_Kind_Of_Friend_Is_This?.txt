What kind of friend is this
Speakin' like an awful man
She don't form part of me
She don't long to follow me
Well, every kind of thing I was . . .
du du, du du, du du, du du
du du, du du, du du, du du, du
[That was the run]
du du, du du, du du, du du
Tell me what kind of friend is this
What kind of friend is this?
Who loves me behind my back
What kind of friend is this
Shows up every place I've been
She act kind of 'lone
but she don't
She making a loan
But you know she won't
She got a language [in] the morning
And she's making it on my bed
Aw, what kind of friend is this.

What kind of friend is this
Losing up anything
Back off, [boy]
When she goes down
[Lay down laid]
She's walking around
Well, she ain't got nothin'
but she's teedle toodle tummin' on a
pack of beens
Tell me what kind of friend is this?
Well, what kind of friend is this
make me holler to and fro
who wants to go everywhere I wanna go
Back off, she

if she could only see

If she comes back along to this [/hiss?].
Tell me what kind of friend is this?

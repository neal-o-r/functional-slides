Lady came from Baltimore,
All she wore was lace.
 She never knew that I was poor,
never saw my face.
Her daddy read the law.
She never knew that I was poor,
And lived outside the law.
Outside her house there was a wall
To keep the robbers out.
She'd never stop to think at all
If that's what I'm about.

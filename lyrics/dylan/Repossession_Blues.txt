Well, I ain't got no money
I'm gonna lose everything I own
 You know a man was coming out this morning
 they want to reposess my home
Well, they took my television
now they're coming for my radio
Well, they took my television
now they're coming for my radio
They don't like the way I'm doing

Was a man he came out and got it and now I
got to walk everywhere

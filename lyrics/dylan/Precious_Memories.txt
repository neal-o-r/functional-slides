 As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
 Precious memories flood my soul
Precious father loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memories appears
 As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
 Precious memories flood my soul

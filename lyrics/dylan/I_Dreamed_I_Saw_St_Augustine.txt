Alive as you or me,
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery,
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold,
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold.
"Arise, arise," he cried so loud,
With a voice without restraint,
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint.
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own,
But go on your way accordingly
And know you're not alone."
[Harmonica verse]
Alive with fiery breath,
That put him out to death.
So alone and terrified,
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried.

Well I ain't a-got my child-hood
Or friends I once did know
No I ain't a-got my childhood
Or friends I once did know
But I still got my voice left
I can take it anywhere I go
An I've never had much money
But I'm still around somehow
No I've never had much money
But I'm still around somehow
But I ain't never yet bowed
Trouble oh trouble
I've trouble on my mind
Trouble oh trouble
Trouble on my mind
But the trouble in the world, Lord
Is much more bigger than mine
To jump at my command
No I ain't a-got no armies
To jump at my command
But I don't need no armies
I got me one good friend
I been kicked an' whipped an' trampled on
I been shot at just like you
I been kicked an' whipped an' trampled on
I been shot at just like you
But as long as the world keeps turnin'
I just keep turnin' too
Well my road might be rocky
The stones might cut my face
My road might be rocky
The stones might cut my face
But there's some folks ain't got no road at all
They gotta stand in the same old place

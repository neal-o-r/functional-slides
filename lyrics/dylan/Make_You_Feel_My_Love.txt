When the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
I could offer a warm embrace
to make you feel my love
When evening shatters and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
Oh there's nothing that I wouldn't do
to make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
nothing that I wouldn't do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love

Now, there's a certain thing
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And that is that there's a certain way
 we all must swim
If we expect to live off
Of the fat of the land.
Now, there's a certain thing
A fella who never blushes
And that is that one must always
flush out his house
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
"Take care of all your memories"
"For you cannot relive them
And remember when you're out there
Tryin' to heal the sick
That you must always
First forgive them."

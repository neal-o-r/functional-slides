Stone walls, steel bars, a love on my mind.
I'm a three time loser, I'm long gone this time.
Jealousy has took my young life,
all for the love of another man's wife.
But I've had it comin', I've known all the time.
No more stone walls, steel bars or you on my mind.
Stone walls, steel bars, a love on my mind.
I'm a three time loser, I'm long gone this time.
Guards all around me, leadin' my way.
I've had it comin, I tend o'er the line.
No more stone walls, steel bars nor you on my mind.
Stone walls, steel bars, a love on my mind.
I'm a three time loser, I'm long gone this time.
I'm a three time loser, I'm long gone this time.

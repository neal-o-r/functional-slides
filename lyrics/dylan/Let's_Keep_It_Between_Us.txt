Let's keep it between us.
These people meddlin' in our affairs, they're not our friends.
Let's keep it between us
Before the last door closes and the whole thing breaks down and ends.
They tell me one thing, tell you another
'til we don't know who to trust.
Oh, darlin',   can we keep it between us?
Let's keep it between us.
We've been through too much together that they've never shared.
They've had nothing to say to us before,
Now all of a sudden it's as if they've always cared.
All we need is honesty,
just a little humility and trust.
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Can we lay back for a moment
'Fore the whole thing breaks down and goes to fire?
If we can't settle it by ourselves,
we must be worse off than they think we are.
Backseat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel,
but they sure know how to make a fuss.
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Can we lay back for a moment
'fore the whole [...] risin' over your head?
They talked about us both behind our back
so loud I could hear every word they said.
In the company of fools we've falled, honey,
Let's just move to the back of the back of the bus
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Let's keep it between us.
These people meddlin' in our affairs, they're not our friends.
Let's keep it between us
Before the last door closes and the whole thing breaks down and ends.
They tell me one thing, tell you another
'til we don't know who to trust.
Oh, darlin',   can we keep it between us?

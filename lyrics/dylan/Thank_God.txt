There's a road that straight and narrow
That the saints have travelled on
filled with all the tribulations
of the martyrs that have gone
If you're grateful for their victory
and for showing us the way
Give thanks for all your blessing,
get on your knees and pray
There's a world of pain and sorrow
filled with selfishness and greed.
To supply our every need
You can find it in the temple
With a welcome on the door
But be sure to count your blessings
Before you ask for more.
Be forgivin to the wayward
Like the Master told us to
For they know not what they do
They would change their way of livin'
If they could but understand
So remember they're your brothers
They need a helpin' hand.

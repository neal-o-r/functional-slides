I was born in Dixie in a boomer shack
Just a little shanty by the railroad track
Freight train was it taught me how to cry
hummin' of the driver was my lullaby
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my old ma here,
She was the only daugther of an engineer
My sweetheart loved a brakeman and it ain't no joke
It's a shamethe way she keeps a good man broke
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I gotta go oh mama, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
I never can go, because you know
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes.

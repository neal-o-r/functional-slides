When the storms of life are raging,
When the storms of life are raging,
When the world is tossing me
Like a ship upon the sea
Thou who rulest wind and water,
In the midst of tribulation,
In the midst of tribulation,
When the hosts of hell prevail,
And the faith going to fail,
Thou Who knowest all about me,
Stand by me (stand by me).
When I'm growing old and feeble,
When I'm growing old and feeble,
And my friends misunderstand

   Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
   All night long I've cried
   But I can't get you off of my mind.
Didn't think you would leave me behind
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
Do you think that it's smart
to jump from heart to heart
When I can't get you off of my mind.
   Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
   All night long I've cried
   But I can't get you off of my mind.
You believe that a true love is blind
So you fool ev'ry new love you find
You've got stars in your eyes
but they can't hide the lies
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.
   Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
   All night long I've cried
   But I can't get you off of my mind.

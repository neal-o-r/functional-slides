shining down like ghost
Can't you hear me crying?
Tell me, tell me baby
Just where you stayed last night.
Can't you hear me crying?
Please stop your train, and
let a poor boy ride.
Can't you hear me crying?
Tell me, tell me baby
Just what's the matter here.
Can't you hear me crying?
Hey you been fooling
Can't you hear me crying?

Black Jack Davey come a-riden' on back,
A-whistlin' loud and merry.
Made the woods around him ring,
And he charmed the heart of a lady,
Charmed the heart of a lady.
"How old are you, my pretty little miss,
How old are you, my honey"
She answered to him with a lovin' smile
"I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Be sixteen come Sunday."
"Come and go with me, my pretty little miss,
Come and go with me, my honey,
Take you where the grass grows green
You never will want for money
You never will want for money
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes
All made of Spanish leather.
Get behind me on my horse
And we'll ride off together,
We'll both go off together."
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes
Made of Spanish leather.
Got behind him on his horse
And they rode off together.
They rode off together.
At night the boss came home
Inquiring about this lady.
The servant spoke before she thought,
"Well, saddle for me my coal black stud,
He's speedier than the gray.
I rode all day and I'll ride all night,
And I'll overtake my lady.
I'll bring back my lady."
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight,
Till he came to a river ragin',
And there he spied his darlin' bride
"Pull off, pull off them long blue gloves
All made of the finest leather.
Give to me your lily-white hand
And we'll both go home together.
We'll both go home together."
Well, she pulled off them long blue gloves
All made of the finest leather.
Gave to him her lily-white hand
And said good-bye forever.
Bid farewell forever.
"Would you forsake your house and home,
Would you forsake your baby?
Would you forsake your husband, too,
"Well, I'll forsake my house and home,
And I'll forsake my baby.
I'll forsake my husband, too,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed
Between my husband and baby.
Tonight I lay on the river banks
Black Jack Davey come a-riden' on back,
A-whistlin' loud and merry.
Made the woods around him ring,
And he charmed the heart of a lady,
Charmed the heart of a lady.

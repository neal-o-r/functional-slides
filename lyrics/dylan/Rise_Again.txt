Go ahead, drive the nails through my hand
Laugh at me where you stand.
Go ahead, say it isn't me
But the day will come and you will see.
Go ahead, come on and mock my name
My love for you is still the same
Go ahead and try to bury me
But very soon I will be free.
Go ahead, say I'm dead and gone
You will see that you were wrong.
Go ahead, try to hide the sun
And you all will see that I'm the one.

Take the ribbons from your hair
Shake it lose and let it fall
Lay it soft against your skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning bright
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
I don't care what's right or wrong
Help me make it through the night
[instrumental verses]
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
And today is also dead and gone
Help me make it through the night.

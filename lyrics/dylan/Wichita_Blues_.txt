[intro:]
And when I left Wichita the weather was blowin' free
And when I left Wichita the wind was blowing free
Well, my poppa said, "Son, Watch out, you might catch that old T.B"
Operator said, "Son, you ain't no friend of mine."
Operator, operator Let a poor boy ride.
Operator, operator, oh Let a poor boy ride.
Can't you see my standing here, how tears are running down my eyes.
[...] let me ride your train
[...] let me ride your train
Lord, I'm standing in the weather, Lord, clouds look like it will rain.
Going down to Louisiana where that green river runs
Going down to Louisiana where that green river runs
Lord, I just went out, my ramblin' is just begun.
And when I left Wichita the weather was blowin' free
And when I left Wichita the wind was blowing free
Well, my poppa said, "Son, Watch out, you might catch that old T.B"

Come on brother, join the band,
Come on sisters, clap your hands,
Tell everybody in every land,
I  ain't a-gonna grieve no more.
Brown and blue and white and black,
We're one color on the one-way track,
We got this far and ain't a-goin' back
And ain't a-gonna grieve no more.
We're gonna notify your next of kin,
You're gonna raise the roof 'til the house falls in.
You can knock us down, we'll get up again,
We ain't a-gonna grieve no more.
We'll sing this song all night long,
Sing it to my baby from midnight on.
She'll sing it to you when I'm dead and gone,
Ain't a-gonna grieve no more.

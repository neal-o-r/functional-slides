One evenin' for pleasure
I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Where beauty an' pleasure were known
I spied a fair maid at her labor
Which caused me to stay for a while
An' I thought of a goddess of beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.
I humbled myself to her beauty
"Fair maiden where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended
Abidin' in Cupid's fair throne."
"Young man I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more that my heart can endure.
Therefore I'll remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"Young maiden I wish not to banter
'T'is true I've come here in disguise
I came here to fulfill our last promise
An' hoped to give you a surprise
I own you're a maid I love dearly
An' you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsel
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle."

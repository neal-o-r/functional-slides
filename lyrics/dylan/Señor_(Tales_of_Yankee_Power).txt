Señor, señor, can you tell me where we're headin'?
Seems like I been down this way before.
 Is there any truth in that, señor?
Señor, señor, do you know where she is hidin'?
How long are we gonna be ridin'?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort there, señor?
Señor, señor, I can see that painted wagon,
smell the tail of the dragon.
Can't stand the suspense anymore.
Can you tell me who to contact here, señor?
Señor, señor, you know their hearts are as hard as leather.
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together.
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
I'm ready when you are, señor.
Señor, señor, let's overturn these tables,
Disconnect these cables.
This place don't make sense to me no more.
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, señor?

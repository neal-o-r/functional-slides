Look who's back in town
All you boys better run for cover
If you don't a-wanna be a broken hearted lover.
See her in that very tight skirt
Got what it takes just to make you hurt
Don't be deceived by those big bright eyes
Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies.
I'll go see them come down my way
Like a fool you're gonna hear me say:
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down".

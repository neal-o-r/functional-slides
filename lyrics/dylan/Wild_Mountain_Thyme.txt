Oh the summertime is coming
And the leaves are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Blooms around the purple heather.
Will you go, lassie, go.
If my true love she won't go,
I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
From all around the purple heather.
Will you go, lassie, go.
I will build my love a tower   *)
At the foot of yonder mountain  *)
All the flowers of the mountain
Will you go, lassie, go.

I'll remember you
 When I've forgotten all the rest,
You to me were true,
 You to me were the best.
When there is no more,
You cut to the core
 Quicker than anyone I knew.
 In the great unknown,
I'll remember you.
I'll remember you
At the end of the trail,
I had so much left to do,
I had so little time to fail.
There's some people that
You don't forget,
Even though you've only seen 'm
One time or two.
When the roses fade
I'll remember you.
I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
It was you who came right through,
It was you who understood.
That you'd have liked me to.
My dear sweet friend,
I'll remember you.

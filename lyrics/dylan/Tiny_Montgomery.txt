Well you can tell ev'rybody
Now ev'ry boy and girl's
Gonna get their bang
Gonna shake that thing
Tell ev'rybody
Down to say hello
They're all gonna take on down
One bird book
And a buzzard and a crow
That Tiny's gonna say hello
Scratch your dad
Suck that pig
And bring it on home
Pink that dream
And nose that dough
Now he's king of the drunks
An' he squeezes, too
Join the monks
Now grease that gig
And play it blank
[tell them to] Go on out
And gas that dog
Flower that smoke
Take it on down
begin to grow
Now, play that low
And pick it up
In a bowled cup
Three-legged man
And a hot-lipped hoe
Montgomery says hello
Well you can tell ev'rybody
Montgomery says hello

And disappeared [like when he taught]
 He came down onto his own
His own knew him not
 But as for me,
[He said when the fig tree was blooming]
He would be at the gate
He was talking 'bout the state of Israel
From nineteen fourty-eight
And the time is near, and
When He was down conceived [here]
His mother didn't know what she carried
Took an angel of the lord
to tell her what she done carry
Carry for all mankind, that
[....] who repaired the roof
[tried to tilt] against the grain
When Herod found out that he was born
He had every boy child slain
Hey, let's all pray

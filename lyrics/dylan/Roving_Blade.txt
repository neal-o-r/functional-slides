In Newry town, where I was bred and born,
I served my time there to the saddlers' trade,
And I always was a roving blade.
At seventeen I took a wife,
And I loved her dearer than I loved my life;
And for to keep her both neat and gay,
I went a-robbing on the King's highway.
I never robbed any poor man yet,
Nor any tradesman did I beset;*)
But I robbed lords and their ladies fair,
And brought their jewels to my heart's delight.
With my dear wife for to see the play;
Lord Fielding's men did me pursue,
And taken was I by the cursed crew.
My father cried, "My darling son."
My wife she cried, "I am undone."
My mother tore her white locks and cried
that in the cradle I should have died.
When I am dead and in my grave
A flashy funeral pray let me have;
Six highwaymen for to carry me.
Give them broadswords and sweet liberty.
Six pretty fair maids to bear my Pall,
Give them white garlands and ribbons all.*)
And when I'm dead they will speak the truth,
He was a wild and a wicked youth.

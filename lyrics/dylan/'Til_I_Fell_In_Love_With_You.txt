Well my nerves are exploding
And my body is tense
I feel like the whole world
got me pinned up against the fence
I been hit too hard
Seen too much
Nothing can heal me now
But your touch
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
Well my house is on fire
Burnin' to the sky
Well I thought it would rain
But the clouds passed by
To the end of my way
And he won't lead me astray
I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
Boys in the street
Beginnin' to play
Girls like birds
You will remember my name
I'm gonna win my way
To wealth and fame
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
Well junk's pilin' up
Takin' up space
Like they're fallin' off my face
Sweat fallin' down
I'm starin' at the floor
I'm thinkin' about that girl
Who won't be back no more
I just don't know what to do
I was allright 'til I fell in love with you
Well I'm tired of talkin'
I'm tired of tryin' to explain
My attempts to please you
They were all in vain
Tomorrow night
Before the sun goes down
If I'm still among the livin'
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I was allright 'til I fell in love with you

When he's got the hogshead up on his toe
Love that country pie
Listen to the fiddler play
When he's playin' 'til the break of day
Love that country pie
Saddle me up my big white goose
Tie me on 'er and turn her loose
Love that country pie
Shake me up that old peach tree
Little Jack Horner's got nothin' on me
Love that country pie

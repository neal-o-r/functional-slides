I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land . . . [ha, ha, ha]
[Start again:]
I was riding on the Mayflower
I have yuh understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, "Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engine, change the sail
Haul on the bowline"
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they are far away at sea
I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Writing up some deeds
He said, "Let's set up a fort
And start buying the place with beads"
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throw us all in jail
For carryin' harpoons
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
Where people carried signs around
I jumped right into line
For five days straight
I went into a restaurant
Lookin' for the cook
I told them I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some suzette, I said
"Could you please make that crepe"
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boilin' fat
Food was flying everywhere
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley
When up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house
I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out
And robbed my boots
And I was on the street again
Well, I rapped upon a house
I said, "Could you help me out
I got some friends down the way"
The man says, "Get out of here
I'll tear you limb from limb"
I said, "You know they refused Jesus, too"
Get out of here before I break your bones
I ain't your pop"
I decided to have him arrested
And I went looking for a cop
I ran right outside
I went out the other door
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
And a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building
Advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door
Like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor
And the man asked me who I was
I repeated that my friends
Were all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card
He said, "Call me if they die"
I shook his hand and said goodbye
Ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road
And knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing
It just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello
This foot came through the line
Well, by this time I was fed up
At tryin' to make a stab
At bringin' back any help
I decided to nip a coin
Like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go
Back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit
It came up tails
It rhymed with sails
So I made it back to the ship
The parkin' ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds
When this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name
They believed me but
They wanted to know
I was employed
They let me go right away
They were very paranoid
He was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy
Sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was
When I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships a-sailin'
They were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was
And how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus
I just said, "Good luck."

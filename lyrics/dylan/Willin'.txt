I been warped by the rain, driven by the snow
I'm drunk and dirty, don't ya know,
Out on the road late at night,
I seen my pretty Alice in every head light
I've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet
Had my head stoved in, but I'm still on my feet
Smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico
Baked by the sun, every time I go to Mexico

Hands off your feet, baby,
listen to this
Often it hurt me honey, I'm
looking at you but
You're looking at me too.
Face on the gutter baby,
which is which but I'd
rather be lucky than be rich
Off with the money honey
that is true, but I'm
Satisfied with you.
All cities, honey, hard, is
soakin' wet, but there's
no more gold you can get
facin' the wall, but
baby you took it all.
Got a gold mining fever, baby, but, ah
which is which, but I'd
Rather be lucky than be rich
[...]
that is true, but I'm
satisfied with you
Got a gold mining fever baby, which is which but
I'd rather be lucky than be rich
Go off with the money honey, that is true, but I'm
Satisfied with you.
Well, I don't mind eating funny honey,
sleep down in the ditch, but I'd
rather be lucky than be rich
[well, all the time I'm]
soakin' wet, but
you got all the gold that you gonna get
[Fall through the sugar, I
Fall through the glue], but I'm
Satisfied with you
should let it go, so I
just wanna know our show]
[...
...show]
Go back as far as you can go
I don't mind honey, 'bout
Sleepin' in the ditch, tell 'em you'd
rather be lucky than be rich
Hold your seat, honey,
back in the ditch, cause I'd
rather be lucky than be rich
Oh, yeah, [...
...]
I love you, and that is all.
[...] motor, honey,
up and down the line,
you tell them that you are mine
[if they heard of you I
must obey,]
you tell them you belong to me
She's from love, honey,
back against the wall, but
you all had it done, got it all.
tell her you're sick but I
wish you'd do it mighty quick
Oh let me see if the
face is soaking wet,
you already got what you gonna get
If they ever ask you to
sleep in the ditch, you tell 'em
you'd rather be lucky than be rich.

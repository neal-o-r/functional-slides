I was born by the river, in a little tent,
 just like the river I've been running   ever since
     It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky,
It's been a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
I go to the movie and I go downtown
Somebody always tellin' me: don't hang around
It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
There been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
I was born by the river, in a little tent,
 just like the river I've been running   ever since
It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will

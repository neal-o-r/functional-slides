Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
I's taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The cavalries charged
Oh the country was young
War had its day
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I's made to memorize
With guns in their hands
It came and it went
The reason for fighting
I never did get *)
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead
Came to an end
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
I've learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
Through many dark hours
I've been thinkin' about this
Was betrayed by a kiss
You'll have to decide
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And then fall to the floor
He'll stop the next war.
It closed out its fate
The reason for fighting
I never got straight
Oh my name it is nothin'
My age it means less
I's taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that land that I live in

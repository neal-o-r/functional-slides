 Our conversation  was short and sweet
 It nearly swept me  off-a my feet.
And I'm back in the rain, oh
And you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow
  You're a big girl now.
Our conversation  was short and sweet
It nearly swept me  off-a my feet.
And I'm back in the rain, mm -  mm
And you are on dry land, mm -  mm
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now.
Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence,
He's singin' his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh,
Singin' just for you, mm-mm.
I hope that you can hear,
Hear me singin' through these tears.
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days .
In somebody's room. m-mm
You're a big girl all the way.
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last.
I can change, I swear, mm-mm
See what you can do, mm-mm.
I can make it through,
You can make it too.
A change in the weather can be extreme
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream
I'm going out of my mind, mm-mm
With a pain that stops and starts, mm-aa
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart.
[one verse intro]
Our conversation  was short and sweet
It nearly knocked me  right off-a my feet.
And I'm back in the rain, oh
And you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now.

For a long time this world has stood
Gets more wicked every day
the maker who created it
Surely won't let it stand this way
This world's been destroyed before
Cause it is too full of sin
For that very reason
It will be destroyed again
If we only give our hearts to God
Let him lead us by the hand
Nothing in this world to fear
He'll lead you across the golden sand

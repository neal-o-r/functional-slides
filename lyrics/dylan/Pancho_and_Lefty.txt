Livin' on the edge my friend is bound to make you [rock a few]

You was your momma's only boy, favorite one it seems
Began to cry when you said, "good-bye",*) sank into your dreams.
Pancho was a bandit, boys, [his horse fast] and his hands were free
He wore his gun outside his pants for all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match, ya know, on the desert down in Mexico
No one heard the dyin' words, but that's the way it goes.
Lefty he can't sing the blues, all night like he used to

They ['d have sent] for another [jour], all the time, and I'll pace you floor
Only let him go so far, so the story goes.**)
The poets tell how Pancho fell, Lefty's livin' in a big hotel***)
[The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold]****) it never mattered anyway.
The day that Pancho drift down low Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go, ain't nobody knows

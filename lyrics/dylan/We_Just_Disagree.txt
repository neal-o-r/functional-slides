Been away, haven't seen you in a while
How've you been, have you changed your style?
What do you think, have we grown up differently?
Don't feel the same, seems like you lost your feel
for me.
I'm goin back to a place that's far away
How 'bout you, have you got a place to stay
Why should I care, I'm just trying to get along
We were friends, now it's the end of our love song.

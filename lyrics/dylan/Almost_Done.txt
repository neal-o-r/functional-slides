I stood by you
Oh don't be untrue
It's already there
for to see the one
oh now she rode
She's almost done
Palestine glow [girl]
You're the one
It might not do
It's already done
for light and blue
almost done
but I don't stand missed
but you're the one
oh you're the child
I'm a-trustin' you
to trust me down
just trust me too
|   . . . ; . . . | . . . ; . .   .   |
All the night
fortune don't last
Gonna be lucky,
more than in the past
It's already there,
Oh, trust in me,
I'll trust in you
[sob me the pros] :-) [or: "save me the prose"?]
goodbye baby
would you hold me close
hold me close
or say goodbye
[moon up by night]
in [the empty] the sky

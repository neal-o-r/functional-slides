If today was not an endless highway, *)
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all.
I can't see my reflection in the waters,
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain,
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps,
Or can't remember the sound of my own name.
There's beauty in the silver, singin' river,
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky,
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
If today was not an endless highway,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all.
If today was not an crooked highway,
                                   lick 1
If tonight I could finally stand tall,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all.
I can't see my reflection in the waters,
I can't speak the sounds that know no pain,
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps,
Or can't remember the sound of my own name.
There's beauty in the silver, singin' river,
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky,
But none of these and nothing else can match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes.

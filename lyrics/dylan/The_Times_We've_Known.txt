The times we've known are slipping by
Iike vapour trails across the sky
The best of times, the worst of times
Have come and gone
The years of debt, the years of doubt
the years of 'what's it all about?'
Of holding fast, and holding out
And holding on
When life was hard and chances few
Still I was rich in having you
Though people said we wouldn't go far
We went ahead and here we are
Together still remember me
Together still through everything
The times we've known
Sometimes the years were lush and green
Sometimes we lived on hope alone
A little bit of both have been
The times we've known
Some lucky flings, some rotten breaks
Some funny things, a few mistakes
The dreams that every dreamer takes
And makes his own
The time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to let the world go by
And if there were some tears to pay
No one can take those years away
On fragile wings our days have flown
Still we have things to call our own
The times we've known
The times we've known

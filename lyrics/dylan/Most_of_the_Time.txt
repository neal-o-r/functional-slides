Most of the time
I'm clear focused all around
Most of the time
I can keep both feet on the ground
  I can follow the path,  I can read the sign
  Stay right with it   when the road unwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I don't even notice   she's gone
Most of the time.
Most of the time it's well understood
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could
I can make it all match up
I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive and I can endure
And I don't even think about her
Most of the time.
Most of the time my head is on straight
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate
I don't build up illusion 'til it makes me sick
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time.
Most of the time I'm halfway content
Most of the time I know exactly where it went
I don't cheat on myself I don't run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I don't compromise and I don't pretend
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time.
Most of the time 
I'm clear focused all around
Most of the time 
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path, I can read the signs
stay right with it when the road unwinds
I can handle what I stumble upon
I don't even notice she's gone
Most of the time
Most of the time 
I'm-a cool underneath
Most of the time 
  I can keep it right between my teeth
I can solve any riddle, I can hold my own
deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive, I can endure
I don't even think about her
Most of the time
Most of the time
my head is on straight
Most of the time
I'm strong enough not to hate
I got enough faith and I got enough strength
I keep it all away, way beyond arm's length
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time
Most of the time 
 I'm halfways content
Most of the time
I know exactly where it all went
I don't cheat on myself,
 I don't run and hide
 Hide from the feelings
 that are buried inside
 I don't compromise or pretend
 I don't even care if I  ever see her again
Most of the time.

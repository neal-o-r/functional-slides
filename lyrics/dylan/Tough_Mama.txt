  Meat shakin' on your bones
  go down to the river and get some stones.
Sister's on the highway with that steel-drivin' crew,
Papa's in the big house, his workin' days are through.
Can I blow a little smoke on you?
Won't you move it on over and make some room?
to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.
With that long night's journey in your eyes.
Born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest,
you know who you are and where you've been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north
He's buried in your past.
That was over pretty fast.
Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.
With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive.
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch.
It must be time to carve another notch.
I'm crestfallen
The world of illusion is at my door,
I ain't a-haulin'
any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.
Meet me at the border late tonight.

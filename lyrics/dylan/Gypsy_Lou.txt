If you getcha one girl, better get two
She's a ramblin' woman with a ramblin' mind
Leavin' some poor boy behind.
Hey, 'round the bend
Well, I seen this whole country through
Seen it up, seen it down
Hey, 'round the bend
Well, I gotta stop and take some rest
My poor feet are second best
My poor feet are wearin' thin
Hey, gone again
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend.
Well, seen her up in old Cheyenne
Turned my head and away she ran
Hey, 'round the bend
Well, I tell you what if you want to do
Tell you if you'll wear out your shoes
If you want to wear out your shoes
Hey, gone again
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend
Gypsy Lou's 'round the bend.
Moved away to Washington.
Hey, 'round the bend
I skipped the ground and hopped a train
She's in a Memphis calaboose
She left one too many a boy behind
He committed suicide.
Hey, you can't win

Railroad Bill, he ain't so bad,
killed his mommy, shot a [round] in his dad [/around with?]
Railroad Bill took my wife.
If I'd said a word, he'd have taken my life
Railroad Bill he was comin' down the hill
Lightin' cigars with a ten-dollar bill
Ten policemen, all dressed in black,
coming out of nowhere, walking down the tracks,
and they're looking for Railroad Bill
Railroad Bill, [comin' round the bend][/fence?]
Robbin' a passenger train for 16 cents
Railroad Bill got in a gamblin' game
shot a man down, though he was to blame
when you lose your mind, let it [turn?] loose
He's down in a jailhouse singin' railer's blues
Same old pants on your passenger shoes
When you lose your mind, let it loose
Railroad Bill he's a mighty bad man
Shot the lantern from a brakeman's hand
Just to see that man suffer pain.

 Far away where the soft winds blow
Far away from it all
 There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall.
Far away in the stormy night
Far away and over the wall
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall.
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup
Strippin' away at it all
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall.
Roses are red violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl
I just might have to come to see you
Where teardrops fall.

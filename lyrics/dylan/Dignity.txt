Fat man lookin in a blade of steel
Thin man lookin at his last meal
Hollow man lookin in a cottonfield
Wise man lookin in a blade of grass
Young man lookin in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin through painted glass
Searchin high, searchin low
Searchin everywhere I know
Askin the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?
Blind man breakin out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance
She said I dont want nobody see me talkin to you
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?
Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin into the lost forgotten years
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said hed give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
Got no place to fade, got no coat
I'm on the rollin river in a jerkin boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity
Sick man lookin' for the doctors cure
Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what its gonna take
To find dignity
Fat man lookin in the shining steel
Thin man lookin at his last meal
Hollow man lookin in a cottonfield
Wise man lookin in a blade of grass
Young man lookin in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin through painted glass
Searchin high, searchin low
Searchin everywhere I know
Askin the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?
Blind man breakin out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance
Stranger stares down into the light
From a platinum window in the Mexican night
Searching every bloodsucking thing inside
for dignity
Soul of a nation is under the knife
Death is standing in the doorway of life,
In the next room a man fighting with his wife
over Dignity.
Fat man lookin at a ferris wheel
Yellow man lookin' at his last meal
Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
Wise man lookin in a blade of grass
Young man lookin in the days that pass
Poor man lookin through painted glass
I'm searchin high, I'm searchin low
Searchin everywhere I know
Askin the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?
Drunk man listens to a voice he hears
in a crowded room, full of covered-up mirrors
looking to the lost forgotten years
for dignity
Standin' outside the gates of Hell
There ain't nothing to say, there ain't nothing to tell
'bout dignity
Pull into the platform, step off the train
Walk thirty steps, it begins to rain
I'm asking somebody with water on his brain
Have you seen dignity?
Cities in a mess of jackhammer beats
Buses roll by with burned-out seats
A child's eyes look through the creeping streets
She said don't let nobody see me talking to you
She's afraid to tell him what she knew
About dignity
I'm looking east, looking west
See people cursed, see people blessed
Asking everybody like a man possessed
Have you seen dignity?
Blind man breaking out of a trance
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Hoping to find one circumstance
Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
Looking at a glass that's half-filled
Looking at a dream that's just been killed
Asking everybody that's strong-willed
Have you seen dignity?

We three, we're all alone,
Living in a memory,
My echo, my shadow, and me.
We three, we're not a crowd,
We're not even company,
My echo, my shadow, and me.
What good is the moon,
The silvery moon,
That shines above?
I walk with my shadow,
I talk with my echo
But where is the one I love?
We three, we'll wait for you
Even 'til eternity,
My echo, my shadow, and me.

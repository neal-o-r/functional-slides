A lightweight contender, like father like son
He fought for the title with Frias in Vegas
And he put him away in round number one
Seven weeks later he was back in the ring
Some have the speed and the right combinations
If you can't take the punches, it don't mean a thing
They made hypocrite judgements after the fact
But the name of the game is be hit and hit back

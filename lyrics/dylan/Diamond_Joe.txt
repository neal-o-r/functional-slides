Gonna buy me a jug of rum,
Gonna give my baby some
Diamond Joe, you better come and get me,
[Instrumental verse]
Gonna buy me a jug of whiskey
Gonna make my baby frisky
Diamond Joe, you better come and get me,
[Instrumental verse]
Gonna buy me a sack of flour
Cook hoe-cakes by the hour
Diamond Joe, you better come and get me,
[2 Instrumental verses]

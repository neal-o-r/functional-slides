 I can hear her heartbeat from a thousand miles
 And the heavens open every time she smiles
 And when I come to her that's where I belong
 Yeah, I'm running to her like a river's song
[She's got a] fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
Yeah, when I come to her when the sun goes down
take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like the thief
And when I'm returning from so far away
gives me some sweet lovin', brightens up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me whole
Yes it makes me mellow down into my soul

 God knows you ain't pretty,
 God knows it's true.
 God knows there ain't anybody
Ever gonna take the place of you.
God knows it's a struggle,
God knows it's a crime,
God knows there's gonna be no more water
But fire next time.
God knows it's fragile,
God knows everything,
God knows it could snap apart right now
Just like putting scissors to a string.
God knows that when you see it,
God knows you've got to weep,
God knows the secrets of your heart,
He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
God knows there's a river,
God knows how to make it flow,
God knows you ain't gonna be taking
Nothing with you when you go.
God knows there's a purpose,
God knows there's a chance,
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance.
God knows there's a heaven,
God knows it's out of sight,
God knows we can get all the way from here to there
Even if we've got to walk a million miles by candlelight.
 God knows you ain't pretty,
 God knows it's true.
 God knows there ain't anybody
Ever gonna take the place of you.
 God knows it's true.
 God knows that there ain't anybody
Ever gonna take the place of you.
God knows it's fragile,
God knows everything,
God knows it could snap apart right now
Just like putting scissors to a string.
God knows there's a river,
God knows how to make it flow,
God knows, when you leave this place
you ain't taking nothing with you when you go.
God knows there's a purpose,
God knows there's a chance,
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance.
 God knows it's true.
 God knows ain't gonna   be anybody
Ever in the world like you.
God knows it's a struggle,
God knows it's a crime,
God knows ain't gonna be no more water
But fire next time.
God knows there's a purpose,
God knows there's a chance,
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance.
[full band enters]
God knows there's a river,
God knows how to make it flow,
God knows, you ain't gonna be taking
nothing with you when you go.
God knows there ain't nobody
ever gonna take the place of you
God knows everybody got to have
someone in the world somewhere
God knows there's an answer
God knows it's all in place
God knows it might be working right now
Look into this right straight in the face
God knows you're hard to find
God knows you're standing right there before my very eyes
Messing up my mind
God knows there's a purpose
God knows there's a chance
God knows we can rise above the darkest hour
of any circumstance.

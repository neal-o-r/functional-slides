You angel you
You got me under your wing.
The way you walk and the way you talk
I feel I could almost sing.
You angel you
You're as fine as anything's fine.
I just want to watch you talk with your
memory on my mind
You angel you
You're as fine as can be
The way you walk and the way you talk
it's the way it ought to be
You angel you
You got me under your wing.
The way you walk and the way you talk
I swear it would make me sing.

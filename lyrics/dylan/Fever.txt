Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
You know, I get a fever that's hard to bear
had a very mad affair
When he put his arms all around her
she said, "I get a fever that's so hard to bear"
Sun lights up the daytime,
moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name,
cause I know you gonna treat me right

You give your hand to me
and then you say hello
my heart is beating so
That anyone can tell:
You think you know me well,
but you don't know me                               Original lyrics:
No you don't know the one
(that) lay awake at night                           Who dreams of you at night;
Dreams to hold you close                            And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
No, you don't know me
You give your hand to me
and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
anyone can tell:                                    Oh, you'll never ever know
You think you know me well,                         The one who loved you so.
But you don't know me                               Well, you don't know me

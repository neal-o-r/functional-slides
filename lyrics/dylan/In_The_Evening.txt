In the evening, baby, when the sun goes down
In the evening, when the sun goes down
Sure gets lonesome when your baby's not around.
[Full verse, one-note (B) harp interlude,
followed by one verse of free harp solo]
Sure gets lonesome, sleepin' all by yourself
Sure gets lonesome, baby, sleepin' all by yourself
When you're lovin' somebody, and   she's sleepin' with somebody else
when the sun goes down
[Harp solo:]
               x4
In the evening,                     mama, when the sun goes down (Oooh Lord)
In the evening, when the sun goes down
Sure gets lonesome when your baby's not around,
when the sun goes down.
[Harp solo verse again]
In the evening, in the evening, mama, when the sun goes down
In the evening, mama, when the sun goes down
Sure gets lonesome when your baby's not around,
when the sun goes down.

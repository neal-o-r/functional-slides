You ask me, stranger, why I make this journey
Why I cross three thousand miles of rolling waves.
Like so many others my love was killed in action.
So I'm here searching for his grave.
Beside each crossmark there all around me
I'll kneel down and gladly say a prayer
For all the dear loved ones home across the ocean
Whose hearts like mine lie buried over here.

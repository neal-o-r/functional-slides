I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody (repeat)
I can manipulate people as well as anybody
Hold 'em and control 'em, please 'em an' squeeze 'em
I can make believe I'm in love with almost anybody
Burst 'em an' burn 'em, [cram]'em and leave 'em      [or "jam"?]
But they're not my purpose as I make the deeds
I been down that road, I know where it leads.
I can deceive people as well as anybody
I know all the angles, know how to make the jangles
I can twist the truth as well as anybody
Find 'em an' blind 'em, wine 'em an' dine 'em
But it don't suit my purposes, it ain't my goal
To gain the whole world and give up my soul.
I can mislead people as well as anybody
I know all the dices, I paid all the prices
I can influence people as well as anybody
I can do it, I can easily see to it
[...] and be gods
I don't miss delusions, I see thru his faades.
I can manipulate people as well as anybody
Burst 'em an' burn 'em, twist 'em an' turn 'em
I can make believe I almost love anybody
Haul 'em an' control them, squeeze 'em and tease 'em
But it don't suit my purposes, it ain't my goal
To gain the whole world and give up my soul.

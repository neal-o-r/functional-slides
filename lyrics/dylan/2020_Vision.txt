I went to the doctor, he says I'm alright.
I knew he was lyin', I'm losing my sight.
He should have examined the eyes of my mind
20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.
She's gone and left, I feel so alone.
I carry a heart as heavy as stone.
I knew she was cheatin', I knew all the time
20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.
With my eyes wide open I lay in my bed.
If it wasn't for dyin' I wish I was dead. *)
But this is my punishment, death is too kind
20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.
You just didn't know her the way that I do.
You say that she's wicked, and maybe it's true.
one thing I know, she's no longer mine
20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.
She's gone, she's gone, oh what shall I do?
you can't be happy if she's there with you.
Some day the heart will trouble your mind
20/20 vision and walkin' 'round blind.

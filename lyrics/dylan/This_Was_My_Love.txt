 Soft as a rain drop, fresh as the sea
Warm as the sunshine  shinin' on me
 This was my love,  this was my love.
Light was her laughter, few were her tears
Gentle her beauty, tender her years
This was my love, this was my love.   D7
Others may cherish fortune or fame
I will forever cherish her name
This was my love, this was my love.
Others may cherish fortune of fame
I will forever cherish her name
This was my love, this was my love

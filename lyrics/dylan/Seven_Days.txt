Seven days, seven more days she'll be comin'
I'll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive.
She been gone ever since I been a child
Ever since I seen her smile, I never forgotten her eyes.
She had a face that outshine the sun in the skies.
I been good, I been good while I been waitin'
Maybe guilty of hesitatin', But I've been hangin' on
Seven more days, all that'll be gone.
Seven days, seven more days that are connected
Just like I expected, she'll be comin' on forth,
My beautiful comrade from the north.

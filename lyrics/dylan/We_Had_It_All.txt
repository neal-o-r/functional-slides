I can hear that wind   blowin' in my mind
Just the way it sounded in the Georgia pine
 But you were always there to answer when I'd call
 You and me, we had it all
Remember how I use to touch your hair
Reaching for the feeling that was always there
You were the best thing in my life, as I recall [I remember]
You and me, we had it all [instrumental verse]Never will stop believing in your smile [I remember]
Even though you didn't stay, it was all worth while
You were the best thing in my life, as I recall [I remember]
You and me, we had it all
[You and me, we had it all]
[You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all
You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all
You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all
You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all
You and me, we had it, we had it, we had it, we had it all]
You and me, we had it all

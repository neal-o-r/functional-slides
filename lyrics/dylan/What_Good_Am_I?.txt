If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry
If I see and don't say if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die

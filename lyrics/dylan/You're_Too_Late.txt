If I had someone that's true
It would thrill me through and through
I'd be happy, oh so happy, night and day
Seems each one got a perfect mate
But for me it's always late
And it kills my soul to hear my sweetheart say:
I'll build my castles high
Just to watch them fade and die
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever find a mate
But I came looking o'er the hill
for someone, and I always will
But it just might be my fate to be too late

I've got a couple more years on you, babe, and that's all.
I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.
Ain't that I'm wiser, I've just spent more time with my back to the wall.
And I've picked up a couple more years on you, babe, and that's all.
I've been down more roads than you, babe, and that's all.
I'm tired of runnin' while you're only learning to crawl.
You're headin' somewhere, I've been that somewhere, found it's nowhere at all.
And I've picked up a couple more years on you babe, and that's all.
Now sayin' goodbye, girl don't ever come easy at all.
But you've got to fly 'cause you're hearin' those young eagles call.
And someday when you're older, you'll smile at a man strong and tall.
And you'll say I've got a couple more years on you, babe, and that's all.

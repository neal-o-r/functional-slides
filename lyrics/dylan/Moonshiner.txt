I've been a-a   moonshiner for seventeen long years
I've spent all my-y  money on whiskey an' beer
I go to some hollow and set up my still
And if whiskey   don't kill me then I don't know what will.
I'd go to some bar room and drink with my friends
Where the women can't follow an' see what I've spent
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry
Hmm, dollars when I'm hard up, religion when I die
The whole world's a bottle an' life's but a dram
When a bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.

 Lately I've been having evil dreams,
I wake up in a cold blue glare
I run the tape back in my mind,
wonderin' if I took the wrong road somewhere.
 Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it
I've had my eyes on you baby for five long years,
Well, you probably don't know me at all,
but I have seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
A tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near
There's always some new stranger in the night
To lend a sympathetic ear.
You keep listening to something long enough
you just bound to believe that it's true.
You know there's some things that you put up,
it's gonna come back on you
The [...] is not common and don't last
Whatever's waiting in the future
could be what you're running from in the past
Don't know what you got that I want,
Don't know what I got to give
Don't know how much time I've got,
don't know how long I live
The rebellion in my soul - why was it created?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep me isolated

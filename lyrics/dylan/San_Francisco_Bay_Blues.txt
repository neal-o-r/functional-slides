I got the blues from my baby livin' by the San Francisco Bay
The ocean liners not so far away
I didn't mean to treat her so bad; she was the best girl I ever have had
I said goodbye; I can take a cry, I wanna lay down and die
Sittin' down lookin' from the back door wondrin' which way to go
Woman I'm so crazy 'bout she don't love me no more
Think I'll catch me a freight train cause I'm feelin' blue
Ride all the way to the end of the line thinkin' only you

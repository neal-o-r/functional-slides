Wait for you to change your mind
I'm tryin to walk the line
Well it's way past midnight
And there's people all around
Some on their way up
Some on their way down
The air burns and I'm tryin to think straight
And I don't know how much longer I can wait
I've tried to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand
That my heart can't go on beating without you
Well your loveliness has wounded me
I'm reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was that keeps me loving you so
I'm breathin' hard standin' at the gate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait
Skies are gray
I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
It doesn't matter where I go anymore I just go 1)
If I ever saw you comin' I don't know what I might do
I'd like to think I could control myself
But it isn't true
That's how it is
When things disintegrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait
It's mighty funny
The end of time has just begun
Oh honey, after all these years you're still the one
Well I'm strollin' through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you
Somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
I don't know how much longer I can wait
 Wait for you to change my mind
I'm tryin to walk the line
          *)
Well it's way past midnight
And there's some people all around
Some on their way up
Some on their way down
The air burns and I'm tryin to think straight
And I don't know how much longer I can wait
 Wait for you to change your mind
 Waitin' just making me go blind
Did you ever lay awake at night, your face turned to the wall,
Drowning in your thoughtlessness, and cut off from it all?
I don't know,
Maybe for you it's not that late
But as for me,
don't know how much longer I can wait
It's got to end
Everything about it just feels wrong
Being close to her is where I don't belong
Well, my back is to the sun because the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
I'll stay here
Where I can feel the hand of fate
how much longer I can wait.
Skies are grey
Life is short, and I think of her a lot
I can't say if I want the pain to end or not
Well, the blindness overtaking me is beating like a drum
I don't know where it starts or where it's coming from
That's how it is
When I try to concentrate
how much longer I can wait.
My hands are cold
The end of time has just begun
I'm gettin' old
Anything can happen now to anyone
I walk across the floor till I wear out my shoes
Think you've lost it all, there's always more to lose
She can keep my head on straight
how much longer I can wait.
 Wait for you to change your mind
 For you to walk the line
You ever feel like just your brain's been bolted to the wall,
That you're drowning in your thoughtlessness and cut off from it all?
I don't know,
Maybe for you it's not that late
But as for me,
I don't know how much longer I can wait
It's got to end
Everything about it just feels wrong
I'll pretend
Being close to her is where I don't belong
Well, my back is to the sun because the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
That's how it is 
when things disintegrate
how much longer I can wait.
Skies are grey
Life is short, and I think of her a lot
I can't say whether I want the pain to even end â€“ or not
Well, I'm trying my best to stand on my own two feet
Not have to lean on everybody that I meet
I'm breathing hard, 
I'm trying to concentrate
how much longer I can wait.
My hands are cold
The end of time has just begun
I'm gettin' old
Anything can happen now to anyone
Lonelyness around me diggin at me like a ray
What a piece of work she is to cause my heart to pray
I thought somehow 
that I'd be spared this fate
how much longer I can wait.

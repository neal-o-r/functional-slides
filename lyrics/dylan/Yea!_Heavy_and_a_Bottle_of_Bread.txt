The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day, with a nose full of pus.

For Wichita in a pile of fruit.

Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it.
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells.
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus.

On the very next day, with a nose full of pus.

The sweetest songs are sung by lovers in the moonlight,
The sweetest days are the days that used to be.
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said "Sweetheart, remember me."
A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear,
A brighter smile an' a love more bold and free.
But in the end, fair weather friends may break your heart, dear.
An' if they do, sweetheart, remember me.
You told me once you were mine alone forever,
You were mine till the end of eternity.
But now it's over, dear, and we can never
Be the same except in memory.

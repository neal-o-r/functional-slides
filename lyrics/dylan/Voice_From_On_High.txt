[The Saviour has] paid a great price for me
He died on the hill so [my friends?] should go free
Well, I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet him when he calls on that day
He died on the cross, that old rugged cross
So we should be saved in our sins and our loss
So I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet him when he calls on that day
The Saviour has paid a great price for me
He gave his life on Calvary
So I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet him when he calls on that day
He died on the cross, the old rugged cross
That we would be saved from sin and our loss
So I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And we'll pay our debts on that great judgement day *)
The Saviour who di - ed on cruel Calvary
He shared his life's blood, that the world might be free
So follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet him when he calls on that day
The Saviour has paid a great price for me
He gave his life on Calvary
So follow his footsteps up the narrow way
that'll pay my debt on that great judgement day

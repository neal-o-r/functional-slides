In the night I hear you speak
Turn around, you're in my sleep
Feel your hands inside your soul
You're holding on and won't let go
I've tried running but there's no escape
Can't bend them, and (I know) I just can't break these...
Trying hard to recognize
See the face behind the eyes
Feel your haunting ways like chains
'Round my heart they still remain
I'm still running, but there's nowhere to hide
My love for you has got me locked up inside these...

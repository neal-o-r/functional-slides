Pity the man got one arm
pity the woman that's lost her charm
Don't you pi-ty  me
Don't     pity me
Pity the child out in the cold
Pity the woman <that back one time let go>
Don't pity me
Don't pity me
Pity the angel, got no way to stay
Pity the <stranger or dancers> getting old and grey
Don't pity me
Don't pity me
You got a <little better>
<If you're playin' with me> or <it's plain to see>
So don't you pity me.
Pity the man got one arm
pity the woman that's lost her charm
Don't pity me
Don't pity me
Pity the man got one arm
pity the woman that's lost her charm
Don't you pi-ty  me
Don't    pity me

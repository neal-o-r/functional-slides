Lord I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too
If I clean up sweet mama, can I stay all night with you.
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds
Went to my window, babe I couldn't see through my blinds
Heard my best friend coming around I thought I heard my baby cry.
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby then just let me sit down in your door
If I can't come in here baby then just let me sit down in your door
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
How can I live here baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How can I live here baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Well, that woman I got, man, she do just what she feels.
Lord you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blind
Leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blinds
Well, I've been mistreated and I swear, I don't mind dyin'.

In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You're comin' thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams.
You're blowing down the shaky street,
You're hearing my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time.
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
You won't get anything you don't deserve
Where we were born in time.
In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You can have what's left of me,
Where we were born in time.
In the lonely night
In the stardust of a pale blue light
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams.
I walk alone through the shakin' street,
Listening to my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
When we were born in time.
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I took you close and got what I deserved
When we were born in time.
In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
I think of you from deep inside of me,
When we were born in time.
In the lonely night
In the shadows of a pale blue light
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams.
I walk along through the shaking street,
I'm listening to my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time.
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I took you close and got what I deserved
When we were born in time.
[2nd times intro]
In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You can have what's left of me,
Where we were born in time.

 There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
He would not bow down, he would not fight.
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty.
And nothing wrong could make it right away.
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
He shook the land like a rolling thunder
And made the bells of freedom ring today
With a dream of beauty that they could not take away
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
He healed the sick and fed the hungry
And for his love they took his life away
On the road to glory where the story never ends
(There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
On the road to glory where the story never ends
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
On the road to glory where the story never ends

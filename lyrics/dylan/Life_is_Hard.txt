 The evening winds are still
 I've lost the way and will
 Can't tell you where they went
 I just know what they meant
I'm always on my guard
Admitting life is hard
 Without you near me
The friend you used to be
So near and dear to me
You slipped so far away
Where did we go astray
I passed the old school yard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me
Since we've been out of touch
I haven't felt that much
From day to barren day
My heart stays locked away
I walk the boulevard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me
The sun is sinking low
I guess it's time to go
I feel a chilly breeze
In place of memories
My dreams are locked and barred
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me
 Without you near me

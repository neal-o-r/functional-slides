Well you're comin' down High Street,
walkin' in the sun
You make the dead man rise,
and holler she's the one
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen
Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
You probably don't know, but I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen
I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm movin' along
People think they know, but they're all wrong
You're something nice, I'm gonna grab my dice
I can't say I haven't paid the price
Baby I am the king and you're the queen
Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
Baby I am the king and you're the queen

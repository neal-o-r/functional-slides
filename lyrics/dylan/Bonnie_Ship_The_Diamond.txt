Well, the bonnie ship was a good old ship
She was a-fishin' on a [leading chain]
And me an' John oh was a long catch[-on?]
It was the last of the ones I've seen
Well, we feud all night, the cabin gauge,
It was a-more than feelin' bad
And with all kind friends we watched in fear
It was a naught time we ever had.
We sailed [all the likes] to bind
With no heavy moan, any hearts [of stone]
No aid was cried [tried?] for mine.
Well, now along Cape Fate, 'twas lit in red
It was all in the time of storm.

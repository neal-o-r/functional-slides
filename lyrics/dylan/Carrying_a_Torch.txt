[instr. verse]
 I'm carryin' a torch for you
 I'm carryin' a torch
 You don't know, you don't know what it's worth
 To keep carryin' a torch
Flame of love it burns so bright
That is my desire
Keep on liftin' me, liftin' me up
Higher and higher
I've been going to and fro on this and that
cause I'm still carryin' a torch
You must know, You must know what it's worth
To keep carryin' a torch
I've been calling you on the phone
Cause I'm carryin' a torch
I can do it all on my own
Keep carryin' a torch
I'm carryin' a torch for you, baby
I'm carryin' a torch
You don't know, you don't know what it's worth
To keep carryin' a torch
I've been carryin', I've been carryin' a torch for you, baby
I keep carryin' a torch
[You don't know, you don't know what it's worth]

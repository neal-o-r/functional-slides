Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down
The sun don't shine above the ground
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Oxford Town around the bend
He come in to the door, he couldn't get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my frien'?
Me and my gal, my gal's son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I don't even know why we come
Goin' back where we come from
Oxford Town in the afternoon
Ev'rybody singin' a sorrowful tune
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon
Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down
The sun don't shine above the ground

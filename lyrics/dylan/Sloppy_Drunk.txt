I don't want no reefer right now, I never touch no junk
Just give me a bottle of Jack Daniels, child, I'll get sloppy drunk
I don't want no reefer, I never touch no junk
Give me a bottle of good bourbon, darling, yes, I'll get sloppy drunk
Well, I love my whiskey, great god, gotta have my gin
come on, let's do something nasty, gal, watch the walls break in
Well, I love my whiskey, I got to have my gin
come on, let's do something nasty, gal, until the walls break in
Well, look here Firmin,*) god knows, you're a mess
Folks that say they don't drink no more, I know they don't drink no less
Well, my good friend Firmin over there, aah, he's a mess
Well, he says he don't drink no more, I know he don't drink no less
Well, I'm leavin' town, baby, go on pack my trunk
I got no good bourbon, got no, but this blues got me sloppy drunk
[Rose,] I'm leavin' Frisco, come on, pack my trunk
I never touch no whiskey, but the blues, great god! got me sloppy drunk

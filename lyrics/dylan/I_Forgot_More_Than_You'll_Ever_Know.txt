I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You think you know
The smile on her lips
The thrill an' the touch
Of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you'll find
A heaven of bliss
In each caress
In each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think she's yours
To have and to hold
Someday you'll learn
When her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

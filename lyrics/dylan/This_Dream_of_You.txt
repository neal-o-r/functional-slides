in this nowhere cafe
’fore night turns into day?
I’m so frightened
of dawn
There’s a moment when
all old things
become new again
But that moment
might have come
and gone
playing tricks on me?
I’m lost in the crowd,
all my tears
are gone.
From a cheerless room
in a curtained gloom
I saw a star from heaven fall
I turned and looked again
but it was gone

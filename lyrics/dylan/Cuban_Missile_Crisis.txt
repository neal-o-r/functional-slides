Come gather 'round me people, and a story I will tell
About a night not long ago, you all remember well.
I tell it to you straight and true, I tell it like friend
All about the fearful night, we thought the world would end.
I was walkin' down the sidewalk not causin' any harm
The radio reported, it sounded with alarm
The Russian ships were sailin' all out across the sea
I was worried about an argument I had the day before
Over some small matter, I'm sure it was nothin' more.
But just a day ago, how it wrinkled up my brow
The same thing today seems so unimportant now.

[Well they] tell you of a pie in the sky
 Soon as you're born they put you down
 Twenty foot down underground
Well the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
Soon as you're born, they'll try to do
put your head and foot all over you
From [...] they put you there
Trying to get you anywhere
I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than to live as a puppet or a slave
Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
But between the day you're born and when you die
You know, they never seem to hear even your cry
And the oppressors are trying to track me down
They're trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say, forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done
And I keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave

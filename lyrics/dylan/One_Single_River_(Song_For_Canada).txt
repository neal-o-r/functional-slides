How come we can't talk to each other any more?
Why can't you see I'm changing too?
 We've got by far too long to end it feeling wrong
And I still share too much with you
How come you shut me out as if I wasn't there
What's this new bitterness you've found?
However wronged you were, however strong it hurt
It wasn't me who held you down.
Why can't you understand I'm glad you're standing proud
I know you made it on your own
But in this new pride you've earned, I thought you might have learned
That you don't have to stand alone

Man came to the door, I say, "For whom are you lookin' "
He says, "Your wife." I say, "She's busy in the kitchen cookin' "
Po'   boy, where you been?
I already told you, won't tell you again.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store,
Man says, "Three dollars." "All right," I say, "Will you take four?"
Po' boy, never say die,
Things will be all right by and by.
Workin' like on the main line, working like a devil,
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
Po' boy, dressed in black,
Police at your back.         B(5)
Othello told Desdemona, "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket,
By the way, what happened to that poisoned wine?"
        She said, "I gave it to you, you drank it."
Po' boy, layin' him straight,
Pickin' up the cherries fallin' off the plate.
Time and love has branded me with its claws
Had to go to Florida dodgin' them Georgia laws.
Call down to room service, says "Send up a room."
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
I don't know any more than this.
Po' boy, pickin' up sticks,
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
Knockin' on the door, I said, "Who's it, where you from?"
        He said, "Freddie or not, here I come!"
Po' boy, 'neath the stars that shine,
Washin' them dishes, feedin' them swine.

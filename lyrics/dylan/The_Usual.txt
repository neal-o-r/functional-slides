I'm trippin over dumb drunks at a party
My girlfriend just ran off with the DJ
I'd give her everything I had, but she refused it
It don't matter now, she don't know how to use it
My confidence is dwindling
Where's my pearls, where's the swine?
Fifty silhouettes now tumblin' on the dance floor
Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door
Sixty cigarettes a day because I'm nervous
When will that bitch begin to serve us?
I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life
Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife
She was good, I was unkind
Big Jim says that the second comin's comin'
I think he must be seein' double or something
You can hang around here, waiting for the offerings
I can't win, but I've seen enough, man
A fifth of whisky keep the doctor away
A little more and it's judgment day
I had a future, but she just passed out

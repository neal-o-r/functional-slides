   Wait for the light to shine
   Pull yourself together and keep looking for the sign
   Wait for the light to shine
When the road is rocky and you're carrying a load
Wait for the light to shine
If you find you're friendless on that weary, lonesome road
Wait for the light to shine
   Wait for the light to shine
   Wait for the light to shine
   Pull yourself together, keep looking for the sign
   Wait for the light to shine

Don't forget your brother as you travel through the land
Wait for the light to shine
He may be in trouble, he may need a helping hand
Wait for the light to shine

If your life is empty and you're on your last go-round
Wait for the light to shine
If you hear the chime-knells on the highway you have found
Wait for the light to shine

   Wait for the light to shine
   When your friends forsake you and you haven't got a dime
   Wait for the light to shine
Don't let trouble fool you and your sins will all be gone
Wait for the light to shine
Don't forget it's darkest just before the break of dawn
Wait for the light to shine

   Keep these words before you as you walk that narrow line

Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
Wisdom and might are his                x2 or x3
Are his, yes are his
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever

Wisdom and might are his                x2
18/11 '79
When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
Like him there is no other
He's God all by himself alone
Well to the just he will be faithful
[let it rain fire and] brimstone down
But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Till Lot was safely out of the town
19/11 '79
When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
With him there is no other
He's God all by himself alone
Well to the just he will be faithful
[hittin' on/he won't] drive you out of town
But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Till Lot was safely out of the town
20/11 '79
When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
Like him there is no other
He's God all by himself alone
Way back down in the days of Noah
He'd drive you out of the town
But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Till Lot was safely out of the town
21/11 '79
Sit up high on a throne
He will not share his glory
He's God all by himself alone
[Well jumpin'] in the days of Noah
[sending] fire and brimstone down
But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Till Lot was safely out of the town
[Well in Eden on] the days of power
King on his own time clock
Like him there is no other
And, hey, he will not be mocked
16/1 '80
When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
Like him there is no other
He's God all by himself alone
Well, in the time by the days of Noah
[...] the dark
But not one drop of water fell
Till Noah was safely in the ark
23/1 '80
When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
Like him there is no other
He's God all by himself alone
Listen, back in the days of Noah
[... faithful of the/after] dark
But not one drop of water fell
Till Noah was safely in the ark
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
He sits up high on the throne
Like Him there is no other
...
...
... singing the blues
And He can renew your mind
Well He ... upon the peoples
... He's got His own time clock
He will not share His glory
Way back in the days of Noah
They found Him faithful at the dock
Remember not one drop of water fell
Til Noah was safely in the ark
Well He always will forewarn you
Before He rains fire and brimstone down
He did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Until Lot was safely out of town
He made the mountains
He made the sea
He made the way of salvation
for you and me

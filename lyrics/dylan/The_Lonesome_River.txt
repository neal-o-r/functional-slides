I sit here alone on the banks of the river
The lonseome wind blows and the water runs high
I can hear a voice call [from] out there in the darkness
But I sit here alone too lonesome to cry
We met there one night on the banks of the river
sat there holdin' hands and makin' a vow
That we never would part and be happy together
But the new love she's found - she's gone with him now.

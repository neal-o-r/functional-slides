I've seen love go by my door
It's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow.
Been shooting in the dark too long
When somethin's not right it's wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love,
It always has hit me from below.
But this time around it's more correct
Right on target, so direct,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Crimson hair across your face,
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of
You might be spoilin' me too much, love,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Situations have ended sad,
Relationships have all been bad.
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud.
But there's no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
I'll look for you in old Honolulu,
Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know.
But I'll see you in the sky above,
In the tall grass, in the ones I love,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
I've seen love go by my door
It's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow.
Been shooting in the dark too long
When somethin's not right it must be wrong
You're gon' make me lonesome when you go.
Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known about careless love,
It's always hit me from below.
But this time around it's more correct
Right on target, so direct,
You're gon' make me lonesome when you go.
Crimson hair across your face,
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of
You might be spoilin' me too much, love,
You're gon' make me lonesome when you go
Situations have ended sad,
Relationships have all been bad.
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud.
There's no way that I can compare
All them scenes to this affair,
You're gon' make me lonesome when you go.
I'll look for you in old Honolulu,
Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know.
But I'll see you in the sky above,
In the tall grass, in the ones I love,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
[...] if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of
You might be spoilin' me too much, love,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
[Instrumental verse]
Crimson hair across your face,
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of
You might be spoilin' me too much, love,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

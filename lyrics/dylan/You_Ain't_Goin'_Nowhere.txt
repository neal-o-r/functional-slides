Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't goin' nowhere
How many letters they sent
Morning came and morning went
Pick up your money
And pack up your tent
You ain't goin' nowhere
Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To the tree with roots
You ain't goin' nowhere
He could not keep
All his kings
Supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it
You best feed the cat
The cat needs feedin'
You're the one to do it
You ain't goin' nowhere
Look here you bunch of
basement noise
punchin' bag
I see you walkin' out there,
and you're the one to do it
Pick up your nose, you canary
You ain't goin' nowhere
Just pick up that oil cloth
cram it in the corner
I don't care if your name is Michael,
you gonna need some boards
Get your lunch
you foreign bib
You ain't goin' nowhere
Now look here, you pile of money,
you best go off here to find a file
I've seen you out there beatin' on you hammer,
you ain't no head lettuce
Beat that buzzard
lay 'm on the rug
You ain't goin' nowhere
Clouds so swift an' rain fallin' in
Pack up your money, pull up your tent McGuinn
You ain't goin' nowhere.
Could not keep on keepin' on
We'll climb that bridge after it's gone
After we're way past it.
Buy me some rings an' a gun that sings
A flute that toots an' a bee that stings
A sky that cries an' a bird that flies
A fish that walks an' a dog that talks.

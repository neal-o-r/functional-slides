You wanna talk to me,
you got many things to say
You want the spirit to be speaking through,
but your lust for comfort get in the way
I can read it in your eyes, oh, what your
Heart will not reveal
And that old evil burden has been draggin' you down,
bound to grind you 'neath the wheel
Yonder comes sin.
You see this woman standin' next to me
She's foreign to your sight
Well, her eyes may be a different colour than mine,
but her blood is red and her bones are white.
You've been seeking them eternal, spiritual things,
but your fifty-dollar smile confirms
You're still tryin' to buy your way into the dreams of them
Whose bodies will be food for worms
Yonder comes sin
I say: See them six wild horses, honey
You say: I don't even see one.
You say: Point them out to me, love,
My brother's blood is crying from the grave
but you can't hear the voice
I stand in jeopardy every hour,
Wonderin' what reason you have to rejoice.
Yonder comes sin.
Jeremiah preached repentance
To those that would turn from hell
But the critics all gave him such bad reviews
Put him down at the bottom of a well
kept on talking, anyway
As the people were put into chains
Wasn't nobody there to say "Bon voyage"
or shatter any bottles of champagne.
Yonder comes sin
High cost of survival
Gets a little higher than you expect
When you're trying to get along with your enemies
And still maintain your self-respect
As a child you knew all there was to know
It just couldn't get expressed
Now it scares me to see what you accept as good
At one you wouldn't have settled forless than the best
Yonder comes sin
You turn your back on the hard truth
Just to fatten up your purse
Sings of an unrighteous world
Dare the same thing as a curse
No kingdom made of human hands can stand
In order to possess that corruptible crown
Yonder comes sin.
There's a place down in your soul
Where the law can never touch
You do most likely what you please
And not think about too much
I'll be down the line when morning comes
And that I pulled the hood up for you
So that you could see real good your uninvited guest
Yonder comes sin

Seen a shooting star tonight
You were trying to break into another world
I always kind of wondered
if you ever made it through
Seen a shooting star tonight
Seen a shooting star tonight
what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line
that only you could see
Seen a shooting star tonight
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away
Tomorrow will be another day
Guess it's too late to say the things to you
that you needed to hear me say
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Seen a shooting star tonight
You were trying to break into another world
I always kind of wondered
if you ever made it through
Seen a shooting star tonight

Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 Iff'n you don't know by now
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right
So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never did before
An' it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long, honey babe   *)
Goodbye is too good a word, gal
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
[hm]
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be travellin' on
You're the reason I'll be gone
Don't think twice, 'cause it's all right
So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
[a-ia] like before
An' it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
But don't think twice, 'cause it's all right
Well it ain't no use in turnin' on your lights, babe
An' it ain't no use in burnin' your lamp, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Well, it's lonesome travellin' down the lonesome road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, 'cause it's all right
So I'm ramblin' all by myself babe.
This time, maybe more
And I can't use nobody else, babe
Whatever you claimed before.
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, 'cause it's all right.
Well, there ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow.
And there ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow.
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Iff'n you don't know by now.
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow.
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now)
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 Iff'n you don't know by now
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right, babe
Don't think twice, it's all right

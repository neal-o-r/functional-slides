Well the woman that I love she got a hook in her nose
Her eye brows meet she wears second hand clothes
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
I go half crazy when she calls my name
When she says "ba-ba-ba-ba-baby I l'-l'-love you
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
The woman that I love she got two flat feet
Her knees knocks together walking down the street
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
She ain't much to look at but like I said:
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world
I don't mean to say she got nothing going
She got a weird sense of humor that is all her own
When I got low she sets me on my feet
Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Well the woman that I love she got a hook in her nose
Her eye brows meet she wears second hand clothes
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.

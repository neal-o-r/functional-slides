[shamelessly happy "la la la la"s throughout the intro:]
The man in me will do nearly any task,
And as for compensation, there's little he would ask.
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I think to myself I might not take it any more.
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me.
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen,
But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine.
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.
La la la la etc...
repeat and fade
The man in me will do nearly any thing,
 As for compensation, whatever you wanna bring.
Take a woman like you
To get through     to the man in me.
Storms on the river of no return,
I'd try to teach you how, but I know that you never learn.
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me.
How can you believe it? Well, I guess it's true
I'm lying next to her, baby, but I'm thinking of you
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.
[instrumental verse]
[I] go down to the border beneath the sun
Calling out her name, but, baby, you're the one
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.

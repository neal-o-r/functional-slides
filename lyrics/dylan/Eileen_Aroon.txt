There is a valley fair
There is a cottage there
Far in the valley shade I know a tender maid
Flow'r of the hazel glade, Eileen Aroon.
Were she no longer true
What would her lover do
Fly with a broken chain
far cross the sounding main
Who in the time so fleet
Who in the song so sweet
Dearer her charms to me
dearer her laughter free
Dearer her constancy
Youth will in time decay
Beauty must fade away
Castles are sacked in war
chieftains are scattered far
Truth is a fixed star
1. When, like the early rose,
Eileen aroon!
Beauty in childhood blows;
Eileen aroon!
When, like a diadem,
Buds blush around the stem,
Which is the fairest gem?
Eileen aroon!
2. Is it the laughing eye?
Eileen aroon!
Is it the timid sigh?
Eileen aroon!
Is it the tender tone,
Soft as the string'd harp's moan?
Oh, it is the truth alone.
Eileen aroon!
3. When, like the rising [/dawning] day,
Eileen aroon!
Love sends his early ray,
Eileen aroon!
What makes his dawning glow
Changeless through joy or woe?
Only the constant know -
Eileen aroon!

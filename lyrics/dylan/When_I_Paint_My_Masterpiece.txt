Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Ancient footprints are everywhere.
   You can almost think that you're seein' double
On a  cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece.
Yup, she promised that she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece.
Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum,
Dodging lions and wastin' time.
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em,
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory,
as the daylight hours do increase
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece.

/a-g#-g-f# F . . .
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles,
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police.
Someday, everything is gonna be diff'rent
When I paint my masterpiece.
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Ancient footprints are everywhere.
  You can almost think that you're seein' double
On a  cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece.
Yup, she promised that she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece.

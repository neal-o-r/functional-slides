Well, as we marched down, as we marched down
Well, as we marched down to Fennerio'
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
the name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say
What will your mother say to know you're going away
You're never, never, never coming back-io ?
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O
Come a-running down your stairs
Combing back your yellow hair
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-io.
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone, long gone
He's a-riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Well, our captain he is dead, our captain he is dead
Well, our captain he is dead, died for a maid
He's buried somewhere in Louisiana-O.
As we marched out, to Fennario
As we marched out, to Fennario
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
Would you marry me, your cities I will free,
Free all the ladies in the are-o.
I would marry you, sweet William-o.
I would marry you, sweet William-o.
I would marry you, but your guineas are too few.
I'm afraid my mama would be so angry-o.
what would your mama think if she could hear my guineas clink
see me marching out ahead of my soldiers-o?
If ever I return, your cities I will burn
Destroy all the ladies in the area-o
Come tripping down the stairs, come and make your yellow hair
Bid your last farewell to sweet William-O.
The captain he is dead, and he died for a maid
As we marched out, to Fennario
As we marched out, to Fennario
the captain fell in love with a lady like a dove

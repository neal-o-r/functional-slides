Where are the men
 that I used to sport with?
What has become
  of my beautiful town?
Wolf, my own friend
Even you don't know me
This must be the end
My house is tumbled down
Where are the men
that I used to sport with?
What has become
of my beautiful town?
Wolf, my own friend
Even you don't know me
This must be the end
My house is tumbled down

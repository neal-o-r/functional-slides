The sweetest girl in the world is my blue eyed Jane
We fell in love like turtle doves while the moon was shining down
I asked her then, I asked her when the wedding bells would ring
She said, "Oh dear, it seems so queer, that this could happen here."
Janie dear, listen here, I've come to say farewell
The world is drear without you dear, and now I cannot linger here
I'm going away this very day, oh please come go with me
I'll be sad and blue wantin' you, longin' all day through
The sweetest girl in the world is my blue eyed Jane
We fell in love like turtle doves while the moon was shining down
I asked her then, I asked her when the wedding bells would ring
She said, "Oh dear, it seems so queer, that this could happen here."

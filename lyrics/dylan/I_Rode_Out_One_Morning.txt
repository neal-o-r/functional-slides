I rode out one morning, tryin' to make me a friend
I rode down to the city, no one to refend [to be found?/could I find?]
But my hands they were dirty and my hair it was messed
And I came from the east and I went out to the west.
It's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard ground to walk
It's hard as the nail, it's hard as the rock,
It's hard as the sail that stands to the wind
But they're all not as hard as the love that I'm in.

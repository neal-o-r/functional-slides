There's a place, so I been told,
Every street is paved with gold,
And it's just across the borderline.
When it's time to take your turn,
There's a lesson you must learn:
You could lose more than you ever hope to find.
A thousand footprints in the sand
Reveal a secret no one can define.
That river rolls on like a breath
In between my life and death.
Tell me, who is next to cross that borderline.

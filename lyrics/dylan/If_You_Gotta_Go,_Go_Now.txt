Listen to me, baby,
There's something you must see.
I want to be with you, gal,
If you want to be with me.
It ain't that I'm questionin' you.
To take part in any quiz.
It's just that I ain't got no watch
An' you keep askin' me what time it is.
I am just a poor boy, baby,
Lookin' to connect.
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'
That I ain't got any respect.
You know I'd have nightmares
And a guilty conscience, too,
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do.
It ain't that I'm wantin'
Anything you never gave before.
It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,
It'll be too dark for you to find the door.
Listen to me, baby,
There's something you must see.
I want to be with you, gal,

If you want to be with me.

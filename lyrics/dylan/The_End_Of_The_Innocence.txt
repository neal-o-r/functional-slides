 Remember when the days were long
and rolled beneath a deep blue sky
 Didn't have a care in the world
 With mommy and daddy standing by
 But happily ever after fails
 and we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
 The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly
Oh beautiful for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairytales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie
Who knows how long this will last
Or how we've come so far so fast
But somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
Darling, give me one more kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye
 Remember when the days were long
and rolled beneath a deep blue sky
 Didn't have a care in the world
 With mommy and daddy standing by
 But happily ever after fails
 we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
 The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

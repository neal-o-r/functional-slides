Now that they are gone you know the truth it can be told
They were sacrificed lambs in the market place sold
Now that they are gone you know the truth it can come out
They were never proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
The people thought they were guilty at the time
Some even said there hadn't been any crime
People look upon this couple with contempt and doubt
But they loved each other right up to the time they checked out
Long as you didn't say nothing you could say anything
Now some they blamed the system, some they blamed the man
Now that it is over, no one knows how it began
Man can do what he please but not for as long as he like
Well they say they gave the secrets of the Atom Bomb away
Like no one else could think of it, it wouldn't be here today
Someone says the fifties was the age of great romance
I say that's just a lie, it was when fear had you in a trance

In the deep rollinghills of West Virginia
Where I spent the happy hour of my childhood
In the cabin where we used to dwell
Well, We're all so happy there together
In our little mountain home
But the Saviour needs angels in heaven
To sing by that great white throne
As the years go by I often wonder
Will we all be together some day
And I've lost every hour in the graveyard
Darkness finds me on my knees to pray

I'm glad I've got to see you once again
although we're through, I still love you
I guess I have to call you just a friend
Someone new has just stepped in
I try to tell my heart that I don't need you
But I know that it is just a lie
And if someday his love should prove untrue
I'll be around when he has said goodbye.

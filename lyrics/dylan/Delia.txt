Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around
De-   lia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
    All the friends I ever had are gone.
Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West
When she returned, little Delia'd gone to rest.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Delia's Daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Curtis's looking high, Curtis's looking low
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
High upon the housetops, high as I can see
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me.
All the friends I ever had are gone
Men in Atlanta, trying to pass for white
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out."
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Curtis said to the judge "What might be my fine?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Curtis' in the jailhouse, drinking from an old tin cup
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Delia, oh Delia, how could it be?
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
All the friends I ever had are gone.

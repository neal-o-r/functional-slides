Oh, the cuckoo     is a pretty bird
An' she warbles as she flies
But she never     sings "Cuckoo"
'till the fourth day 'n July
I've a-gambled in England
'An I betchu' ten dollars
That I'll beatchu' next game
I'll build me a cabin
On a mountain so high
When she goes ridin' by
An' could write a fine hand
I'd write my love a letter
Lawd she would understand

I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
You can take an ancient vacation
fly over Florida's deep-blue end
rise up out of this mad-house nation
I'm going down with my oldest tender friend
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
We know each other now twenty years,
seen murders, and we wept tears
Now we're gonna take ourselves a little bit of free time
Wandering round the southern poverty clime
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
Start flyin' with all the poor, old, sick ladies
Everybody [in the plane] [drowded] and drunk, and they're crazy
Flyin' home to die in the wobbly air
All night long, they wanted the cheapest fare.
I'm going down on the old midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
When we're down on the air field, I've never been there,
Except once walkin' around the air field in the great, wet heat,
Walk out, smell that old mother-load of shit from the tropics
Stomach growl [love], oh friends, beware.
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
Me and my friend, no we won't even drink,
And I won't eat meat, I won't fuck around
Gonna walk the streets alone, [cars] will blink and wink
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
Start [read] poetry at the university, meet kids,
look at their breasts, touch their hands, kiss their heads
seen from the heart, maybe the four buddhist normal truths
"Existence is suffering", it ends when you're dead --
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
Go out, walk up on the mountain, see the green rain
imagine that forest, finds, get lost,
sit cross-legged and meditate on old love pain,
watch every old love turn to gold.
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
See raindrops and the jungle rainbow, dancin' men;
brown legs walk around on the mud road
far from US smog, war, again
Sit down, empty mind, vomit my holy load
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
Come back to earth, walk the streets in [shark/sharp?]
Smoke some grass and eat me some cock
kiss the mouth of the sweetest boy I can see
who shows me his white teeth and brown skin joy
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
Go find my old friend, we'll go to the museum,
talk 'bout politics with the cats, and ask for revolution,
get back on the plane and chant high in the sky
Back to earth, to New York garbage streets and fly
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.
I'm gonna come back with frighteneds in the hot
at New York's electrical eternity here
pull the air-conditioner plug from the wall
sit down with my straight spine and pray
I'm going down on the midnight plane
I'm going down with my suitcase pain.

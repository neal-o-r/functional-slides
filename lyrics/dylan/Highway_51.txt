Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand
Running from up Wisconsin
way down to no man's land.
Well, if I should die before my time should come
And if I should die before my time should come
Won't you bury my body
out on the Highway 51.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.

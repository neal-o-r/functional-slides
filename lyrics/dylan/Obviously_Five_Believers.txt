Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to
I'm callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I could make it without you
If I just didn't feel so all alone
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
You know I can if you can, honey
But, honey, please don't
I got my black dog barkin'
Black dog barkin'
Outside my yard
Yes, I could tell you what he means
If I just didn't have to try so hard
Your mama's workin'
Your mama's moanin'
She's cryin' you know
She's tryin' you know
You better go now
Well, I'd tell you what she wants
Fifteen jugglers
Fifteen jugglers
Five believers
Five believers
All dressed like men
Tell yo' mama not to worry because
They're just my friends
Early in the mornin'
Early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to
I'm callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I could make it without you
If I just did not feel so all alone

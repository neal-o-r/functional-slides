How'd ya like to spend Christmas
How'd ya like to spend the holiday
Away across the sea?
How'd ya like to spend Christmas
How'd ya like to hang a stocking
On a great big coconut tree?
If you ever spend Christmas
You will never stray, for everyday
Your Christmas dreams come true.
If you ever spend Christmas
You will never stray, for everyday
Your Christmas dreams come true.

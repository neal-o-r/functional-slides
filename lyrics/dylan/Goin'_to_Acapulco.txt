 She never does me wrong.
She puts it to me plain as day
 And gives it to me for a song.
It's a wicked life but what the hell
[and] everybody's got to eat
And I'm just the same as anyone else
When it comes to scratching for my meals *)
And can't find what I need,
and get something quick to eat.
It's not a bad way to make a living
And I ain't complainin' none.
For I can blow my plum and drink my rum
And then go on home and have my fun
Now, if someone offers me a joke
I just say no thanks.
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks.
Well, everytime, you know, when the well breaks down
I just go pump on it some.
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And just sit there waitin' for me to come.

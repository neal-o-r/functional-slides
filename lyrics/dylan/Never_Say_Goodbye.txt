Twilight on the frozen lake
North wind about to break
On footprints in the snow
Silence down below.
The crashing waves roll over me
Wait for you to come
And grab hold of my hand.
(chaos...)
Oh baby baby baby blue
You've changed you last name, too
You've turned your hair to brown
Love to see it hangin' down.

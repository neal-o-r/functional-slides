Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one   you love
When he's standing in front of you
 Lay, lady, lay,    lay across my big brass bed
 Lay, lady, lay,    lay across my big brass bed
 Whatever colors  you have in your mind
 I'll show them to you  and you'll see them shine
 Lay, lady, lay,    lay across my big brass bed.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs!
Let's take a chance, who really cares?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs!
Stay lady stay, stay with your man a while.
'til the break of day, Let me see you make him smile.
I long to see you in the morning light.
I long to hold you In the night.
Stay lady stay, stay with your man a while.
[instrumental verse]
Lay lady lay, Lay across my big brass bed.

O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy  deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God im --  parts to human hearts
The blessings of all      His heaven.
Where meek souls will receive him still,
The dear Christ enters in.
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth

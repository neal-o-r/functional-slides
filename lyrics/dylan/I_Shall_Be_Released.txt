They say ev'rything can be replaced,
Yet ev'ry distance is not near.
Of ev'ry man who put me here.
They say ev'ry man needs protection,
They say ev'ry man must fall.
Some place so high above this wall.
Now yonder standing here in this lonely crowd,
a man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Crying out that he was framed.
They say ev'ry man must need protection,
 They say ev'ry man must fall.
Some place so high above the wall.
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd,
there's a man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Callin' out that he's been framed.
  They say ev'rything can be replaced,
Yet ev'ry distance is not near.
Of ev'ry man who put me here.
 They say ev'rything can be replaced,
 Yet ev'ry distance is not near.
Of ev'ry man who put me here.

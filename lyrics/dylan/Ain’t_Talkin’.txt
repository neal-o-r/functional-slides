As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden,
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine,
I was passin' by yon cool crystal fountain,
  Someone hit me from behind.
They say prayer has the power to heal, so pray for me, mother.
In the human heart, an evil spirit will dwell.
I am a-tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others,
But oh mother things ain't goin' well.Now I'm all worn down by weeping,
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry.
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping,
I'll just slaughter'em where they lie.Well, the whole world is filled with speculation,
The whole wide world which people say is round.
They will tear your mind away from contemplation,
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down.
They will crush you with wealth and power
Every waking moment you could crack.
I'll make the most of one last extra hour,
I'll avenge my father's death when I step back.All my loyal and my much-loved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome roadWell, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin',
Fame and honor never seem to fade.
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'.
Who says I can't get heavenly aid'The suffering is unending;
Every nook and cranny has its tears.
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending,
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears.As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn.
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon:
There's no one here, the gardener is gone.

Papa writes to Johnny. Johnny can't come home.
Johnny can't come home. Johnny can't come home.
Papa writes to Johnny. Johnny can't come home.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Going home to stay, going home to stay.
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
And I feel like I just want to travel on.
There's a lonesome freight at 6:08 coming through the town,
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
There's a lonesome freight at 6:08 coming through the town,
And I feel like I just want to travel on.

If not for you,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Couldn't even see the floor,
I'd be sad and blue,
If not for you.
If not for you,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Wait for the mornin' light
To shine in through,
But it would not be new,
If not for you.
If not for you,
Winter would have no spring,
Couldn't hear the robin sing,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Anyway it wouldn't ring true,
If not for you.

[Instr. verse]
If not for you,
The night would see me wide awake
The day would surely have to break
But it would not be new,
If not for you.
If not for you,
Winter would hold no spring,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
If not for you.

 Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you
All my bright tomorrows belong to you!
1. Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you
3. No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by ... that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide ... just wait
4. As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

Do wop, do wop,
Do do do wop, do do do wop,
Do do do wop, do do do wop,
Do do do wop, do do do wop,
Do do do wa, ah
 You say you'd ask me,
 You said you'd ask me,
 You said you'd ask me
 To the senior prom. [Elliott: "Say something!"]
Now you won't ask me,
To the senior prom, Oooh...
    Get me a shotgun
      Twenty-two rocket
 I got it for my birthday
I'll kill my parents
'Cause they don't understand,
They don't think it to major at all

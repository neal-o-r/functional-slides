Don't wait up for me. A-worry about me when I'm gone."
He was her man but he done her wrong.

Said to the bartender: "Has my lovin' man been here?"

Frankie went down to 12th Street, lookin' up through the window high.
He was her man but he done her wrong.

Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a forty-four.
Gun went off a rootie-toot-toot, and Albert fell on the floor.
He was her man but he done her wrong.
Frankie got down upon her knees, took Albert into her lap.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringin' him back.
He was her man but he done her wrong.

"Gimme a thousand policemen. Throw me into a cell.
I shot my Albert dead, and now I'm goin' to hell.

A woman shot her lover down. Murder in the second degree."
He was her man but he done her wrong.

Frankie went to the scaffold, calm as a girl could be.
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens. Said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
He was her man but he done her wrong.

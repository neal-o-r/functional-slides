Wonderin', I'm Wonderin', when will my swamp catch on fire
I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin: Is my swamp gonna catch on fire
Sittin' here lookin' at that old bad telephone wire.
Well, I'm goin' to Las Vegas, goin' by the evening sun
I'm goin' to Las Vegas, goin' just as fast as I can run
Gonna win some money, give it to my hon.

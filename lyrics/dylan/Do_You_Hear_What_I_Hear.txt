Said the little lamb to the shepard boy:
Ringing through the sky, shepard boy,
A song, a song,
High above the trees,
With a voice as big as the sea,
With a voice as big as the sea.
Said the shepard boy to the mighty king:
In your palace wall, mighty king,
A child, a child,
Shivers in the cold.
Let us bring him silver and gold,
Let us bring him silver and gold.
Said the king to the people everywhere:
Pray for peace people everywhere.
The child, the child,
Sleeping in the night,
He will bring us goodness and light,
He will bring us goodness and light.

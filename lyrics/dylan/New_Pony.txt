I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
She broke her leg and needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more
than it could have hurted her
she got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next
I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
She got great big hind legs,
long black shaggy hair hanging in her face
Everybody says you're usin' voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh well, everybody says you're usin' voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh, baby, but that god that you been prayin' to
gonna give ya back what you're wishin' on someone else
Come over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you
Well, Come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you
Well, you're so nasty and you're so bad
Well now, it was early in the mornin', I seen your shadow in the door
It was early in the mornin', I seen your shadow in the door
Now, I don't have to ask nobody
I know what you come here for.

Hurry back, hurry back,
Oh my love,    hurry back
for my heart wants you only
Hurry home, hurry home
won't you please hurry home
to my heart
Please come back bella mia
Hurry back, hurry home,
to my arms, to my lips
and my heart.
Cara mia ti amo
Solo tu, solo tu,
solo tu, solo tu

                            and less Dyl-ian: "cuore"

Yonder come my baby all dressed in red.
Hey baby, I'm better off dead.
Cocaine all around my brain.                     F/a G (as in the intro)
Yonder come a baby all dressed in white,
hey baby won't you stay all night.
Cocaine all around my brain.
Yonder come a baby all dressed in blue.
Hey baby, what you're gonna do?
Cocaine all around my brain.
Well up and down 10th street, turned down main,
looking for a guy they call Cocaine.
Cocaine all around my brain.
Then I walked down 10th street, turned down Beale,
looking for a guy they call Lucille.
Cocaine all around my brain.
[instrumental verse + refrain]
Yonder come a baby all dressed in white,
hey baby won't you stay all night.
Cocaine all around my brain.
Everytime my baby and me go up town
police come and they knock me down
Cocaine all around my brain
Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead.
Cocaine all around my brain
Early one morning, half past four
cocaine came knockin' on my door.
Cocaine all around my brain
Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men
Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when.
Cocaine all around my brain.

If the farmer has no silo
And his fuel cost runs up high
Well, that's just how much I would love you
if you'd just only let me try
Two floor birds and a prudent baby chick, yes that's me
That ain't much to bust
But restriction causes damage
And damage causes lust
Well, the whole back-strappers are a dime a dozen
And I can get a cup for a nickle
Yes, but look what an earful I get and it's all awful too
Everytime I try to go get me a little tickle
So, give me one sweet loaf of bread
just one sweet loaf, I'll fill it up and I'll be gone
Yes, just like some of these old floor birds
who fly from dawn to dawn
who fly from dawn to dawn
who fly from dawn to dawn
who fly from dawn to dawn
If the farmer has no silo
And his fuel cost runs him up very high

if you'd just only let me try

Yes, that ain't much to bust
But restriction causes damage
And damage causes lust.

who just flies from dawn to dawn (yes...)
flies from dawn to dawn (look at that old floor-bird, he just...)
flies from dawn to dawn (look at that crazy floor-bird, he just...)
flies from dawn to dawn (what a floor-bird, he...)
flies from dawn to dawn.

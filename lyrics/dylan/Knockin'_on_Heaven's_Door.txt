Mama, take this badge off of me
 I can't use it anymore.
 It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
 I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
Mama, take this badge off of me
 I can't use it anymore.
 It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
 I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

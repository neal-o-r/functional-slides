Take a look at me Baby, I am a teenage prayer
When it's cloudy all the time,
all you got to do is say [...]
(Take a look at me Babe) [good, go ahead] (I'm your teenage prayer)
I'm your teenage prayer (yes I'm your teenage prayer)
Take a look at me Baby (Just take a look over here, at me Baby)
I'm your teenage prayer (I'm your teenage prayer)
I'm your teenage dream (teenage dream, dream, dream, scheme ...)
Take a look at me, Baby (baby)
I'm your teenage dream (yes, and I'm a dream)
Take a look at me, Baby (just take a look over here at me baby)
I'm your teenage prayer (take a look at me, baby, I'm a teenage bear)
Come and take a look at me, Baby (just take a lookin' over here, baby)
I'm your teenage prayer (Yes I'm your teenage hair)
[Yes, I'm your teenage prayer,
You might think I'm not somebody,
you might think I'm nowhere.
But I'm here to tell you I'm your teenage prayer.
I know what you need, I can feel it in my bones,
And I feel it on my throne, You're my teenage prayer.
Any day, any night, you just come to me with your own fright,
and I'm your teenage prayer,]
Take a look at me baby (just take a look at me baby)
I'm your teenage prayer (you know I'm a teenage prayer, baby)
Take a look at me baby (take a look over here baby)
I'm your teenage prayer (I'm the teenage hair)

Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred
'Cept you, yeah you
there's nothing round here to me that matters
'Cept you, yeah you
Nothing 'round here I care to try for
'Cept you, yeah you
Got nothing here to live or die for
'Cept you, yeah you
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me
'Cept you, yeah you
Nothing anymore seems to please me
'Cept you, yeah you

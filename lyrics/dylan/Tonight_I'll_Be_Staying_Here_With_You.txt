Throw my ticket out the window,
Throw my suitcase out there, too,
Throw my troubles out the door,
I don't need them any more
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do.
Oh, your love comes on so strong
And I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
I can hear that whistle blowin',
I see that stationmaster, too,
If there's a poor boy on the street,
Then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Throw my ticket out the window,
Throw my suitcase out there, too,
Throw my troubles out the door,
I don't need them any more
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
  Throw my ticket in the wind
  Throw my mattress out there too
Draw my letters in the sand,
'cause you got to understand
that tonight I'll be staying here with you
I could have left this town by noon
by tonight I'd been to someplace new
but I was feeling a little bit scattered
and your love was all that mattered
so tonight I'll be staying here with you, get ready,
cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowin'
I hear them semis rolling too
If there's a driver on the road
let him have my load
cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowin'
I hear them semis rolling too
If there's a driver on this road
then let him have my load
'cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
'cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

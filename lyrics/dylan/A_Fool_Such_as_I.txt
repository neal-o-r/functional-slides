Pardon me if I'm sentimental, when we say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you're gone I will dream a little dream as years go by
Now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I
Pardon me, pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you're gone, when you're gone, I will dream a little,
I will dream as years go by
Now an' then, now an' then, there's a fool, a fool such as I.
Now an' then, there's a fool
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you're gone, yet I'll dream a little dream as years go by
Now an' then, there's a fool such as I
[Half spoken:]
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
When you're gone I'll dream a little dream as years go by
But you know, now an' then, there's a fool such as I.

Oh hard is the fortune of all womankind
It's always controlled, it's always confined
Controlled by her parents until she's a wife
     Cadd2 /b /a  /c /b   /a      /c   /b /a  G
Then slave to her husband for the rest of her life
She is a poor girl, and her fortune is sad
always been courted by the wagoner's lad
He courted her truly both night and by day
But now he is a-loaded and a-going away
Your parents don't like me they say I'm too poor
They say I'm not worthy to enter your door
But I work for a living, my money's my own
And them that don't like it can leave me alone
My horses ain't hungry, and they don't need your hay
Come sit down beside me for as long as you stay
I'd go to Montana if the moon showed any light,
But my pony can't travel this dark road tonight.
I once had a sweetheart and her age was sixteen
She's the flower of Belton and the rose of Seline.
But her parents was against me, now she is the same,
If I'd writ on your book, love, you just blot out my name.
Hard is the fortune of all womankind
It's always controlled, and it's always confined
Controlled by her parents until she's a wife
Then slave to her husband for the rest of her life.

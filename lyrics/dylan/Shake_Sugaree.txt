I got a secret, and I ain't gonna tell
I'm going to Heaven in a split pea shell
I pawned my watch, and I pawned my chain
I even tried to sell myself, but I got down so ashamed
I've got a song to sing, and it's not very long
I'm gonna sing it right, if it takes me all night long.
I got a secret, and I ain't gonna tell
I'm going to Heaven in a split pea shell.

We have got to come together
How long can we stay apart?
You may get it maybe never
But it's coming from the heart.
Your mind is filled with indecision
You can't make up your mind.
We must get it in position
And move it on down the line.
Make me up a bed of roses
hang it down on the vine
Of all my loves you've been the closest
That's ever been on my mind.
Don't talk to me about tomorrow
I really don't care
This home is filled with too much sorrow
That nobody's heart should bear.
Another man has hurt you honey,
why must I pay for that part?
Our love can't be bought with money
'Cause it's coming from the heart.
Please, please give me indication
Stop and talk to me
Like a river that is flowing
My love will never cease to be.

Ten years ago on a     cold dark night
Someone was shot 'neath the town hall light
The people who saw, well they all agreed
That the slayer that ran looked a lot like me
The judge said "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word though it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
The scaffold was high, eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she shivers over my bones

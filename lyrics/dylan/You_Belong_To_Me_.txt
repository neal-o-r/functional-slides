 See the pyramids along the Nile
 Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle
 Just remember, darling all the while
 You belong to me
 See the marketplace in old Algiers
 Send me photographs and souvenirs
 Just remember when a dream appears
 You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me

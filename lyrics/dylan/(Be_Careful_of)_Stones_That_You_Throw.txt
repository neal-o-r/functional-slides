[fragment:]
. . . and I knew right away
That it was gossip not flowers that she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say.
[new start, in D:]
A neighbor was passin' my garden one time
She smiled and I knew right away
 That it was gossip not flowers that she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say.
"That bad girl down the street, she should be run from our midst.
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
She knows not to speak to my child nor to me.”
My neighbor then smiled and I thought:
A car speeded by, the screamin' of brakes
and a sound that made my blood chill
For  my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl, lyin' still.
Her child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
"Oh, who was that brave girl so sweet?”
I covered the crushed broken body and said
"That bad girl down the street.”

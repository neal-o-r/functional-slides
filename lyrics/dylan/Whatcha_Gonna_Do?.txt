Tell me what you're gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door.

Tell me what you're gonna do
When the devil calls your cards.

When the devil calls your cards.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the devil calls your cards.

When your water turns to wine.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When your water turns to wine.
What shall you do?

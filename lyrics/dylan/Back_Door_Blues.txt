I'd rather see my coffin coming through my back door
I'd rather see my coffin coming through my back door
I'd rather see my coffin coming through my back door
And the girl I'm loving, she says she don't love me no more
When you see me leaving, baby, I should have left so far
When you see me leaving, Mama, I feel I should have left so far
Sometimes I'm a-wond'rin' who you think you are.

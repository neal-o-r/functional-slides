Well the woman I hate, I see her everyday.
The woman I love she's so far away.
[1 verse harp interlude (see below)]
Well the woman I love she's about my size.
She's a married woman, come to see me sometime.
Well put your arms around me like a circle in the sun,
Stay with me baby like my easy rider done.
[long harp interlude]
Well the woman I love she's about my size
She's a married woman, comes to see me sometime.
Well put your arms around me like a circle in the sun
Stay with me baby like my easy ridin' done.
Well the woman I hate, I see her every day
The woman I love she's so far away.

On the banks of the river       where the willows hang down
And the wild birds all warble with a low moaning sound
Down in the hollow where the water runs cold
It was there I first listened to the lies that you told
Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
The past I remember time cannot erase
The letter you wrote me it was written in shame
And I know that your conscience still echoe's my name
Now the nights are so long, ah, sorrow runs deep
Nothing is worse than a night without sleep
I'll walk out alone and look at the sky
Too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry
Now, if the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies wore thrushes
I'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
If the ladies were squirrel's with them high bushy tails
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails

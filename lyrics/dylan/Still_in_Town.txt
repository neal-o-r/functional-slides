To love you still, and have you not
Will destroy me   in time
So I'm goin' away, where nobody knows me
And get you   off my mind
I try to go, but how can I leave
When all roads lead to you
(Yes) I'm still in town, still around
And still in love with you
I try to go, but how can I leave
When all roads lead to you
(Yes) I'm still in town, still around
And still in love with you

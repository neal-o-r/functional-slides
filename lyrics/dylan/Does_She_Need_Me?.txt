Carry my trouble,
 yes you satisfy my mind
I'll try to tell you, if I can't come in
I'll be happy in the morning
 I try my best, I will   try to help you
But I just can't find you away
Won't some time away
That's the way I think she told me [?]
Heart she bent on me [?]
 I'll be out all morning, for you
But you can't stop me
Yes, I try my best to please you
You must help me to see you
Now, if you send me a letter
 I'll be on my way to get it for you
 I'll be with my sister too
I can't find me what to do
Yes, I've been trying to get a message
 To you, but you have to treat me
I won't let her to
to hunt her, you..
[Tape fades out.]
Now she's walking in the morning
Howlin' you come home
 I'll be on my way, so long, forlorn
You just can't go
 If I have to please come home
If  I haunt you back all day
Where she leads me I do not know
Well she leads me where she goes
I can't find her nowhere
Well, she needs me here
All aware, I just can't hear her walk
 I just can't hear her talk
Though sometimes you know you will
And when she comes my way
I'll just be left any night or day
I will hear her say
that I don't wanna try, I tried also cried
But I can't leave her behind
Where she leads me I do not know
 Well she leads me where she goes
I can't find her nowhere
Well, she needs me here
All aware, I just can't hear her walk
 I just can't hear her talk
Though sometimes you know you will
And when she comes my way
I'll just be left any night or day
I will hear her say
that I don't wanna try, I tried also cried
But I can't leave her behind

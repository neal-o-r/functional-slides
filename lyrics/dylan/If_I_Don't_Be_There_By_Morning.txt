upon the horizon,
is on my trail,
And if I don't be there by morning
must've spent the night in jail.
I been runnin'
Had an appointment
set sometime for today
And if I don't be there by morning
must have gone the other way.
waiting for my pay,
And if I don't be there by morning
Pack my clothes,
get down on your knees and pray.
I left my woman
with a twenty-dollar bill,
I left her waiting,
I hope she's waiting for me still.
But if I don't be there by morning
I never will.
[instr. verses and fade out]
upon the horizon,
is on my trail,
And if I don't be there by morning
must've spent the night in jail.

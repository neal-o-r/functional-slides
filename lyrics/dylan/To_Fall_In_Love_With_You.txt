A tear go down
my day is real
but your dying eye
upon the same
and need just road
for me from you
what paradise
what can I do?
That die for my
and the day is dark
I can['t] believe
[for the end of time]
Oh time is rye-ou-lou
'f I fell in love
To fall in love
To fall in love
with you
The day is dark
our time is right
day in the night
deep in the night
I came [dev] be back
I hear-a my-a surprise
I see it in you live
I knew it in your eyes
well I feel your love
and I feel no shame
I can't unleash your horde
I call your name
What were to me
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love
with you
It just rolls
upon the sand
[deverthisse] now
I made the man
can make you feel
what I can find
I know it in my days
Ah in my dreary mind
Oh will ages roll
Will ages fly
I hear your name
where angel lie.
for to come it's true
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love
with you
How can the doors
a trust on a nail
how can I be surprised
of most everything
ah in the distant road
I can['t] be the same
I feel no love
I kill no shame
I can't watch the bay
Out on my an own
we've a destined man
I came atist it all
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love
with you

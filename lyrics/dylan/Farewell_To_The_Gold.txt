Shotover River, your gold it is waning
And it's years since the color I've seen.
No use just sitting, Lady Luck blaming
I'll pack up and make a break clean.
It's nearly three years since I left my old mother
For adventure and gold by the pound.
With Jimmy the prospector, he was another,
For the hills of Otago we were bound.
We worked the Cardrona's dry valley all over
They were panning good dust on the winding shotover
So we headed down there just to see.
We sluiced and we cradled for day after day
Barely making enough to get by;
Then a terrible flood swept poor Jimmy away
During six stormy days in July.

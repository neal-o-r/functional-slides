I'm breathing a lover's sigh.
Well, I'm sitting on my watch
I'm singing love's praises
With sugar-coated rhyme.
On you I'm casting my eye.
I'm paintin' the town,
Swingin' my partner around
I know who to trust
I'm watchin' the roads,
I'm studying the dust
I'm paintin' the town
Making my last go round.
I'm roamin' slow,
I'm telling myself
I've found true happiness,
That I've still got a dream
that hasn't been repossessed.
I'm roamin' slow
Going where the wild roses grow.
Papa gone mad,
Mama, she's feeling sad.
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire
So you can sin no more
I'm gonna establish my rule
Through civil war,
Gonn' make you see
Just how loyal and true a man can be!
I'm breathing a lover's sigh.
Well, I'm sitting on my watch
I'm singing love's praises
With sugar-coated rhymes.
. . .
Making my last go round.

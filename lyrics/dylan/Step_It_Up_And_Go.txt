Got a little girl, little and low,
She used to love me but she don't no more.
          C                *) G                           *) the little figure
She gotta step it up and go   Yeah, go.                      in m. 3 of the tab
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Make a livin' by puttin' on airs.
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, man.
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.
Front door shut, back door too,
Blinds pulled down, what' cha gonna do?
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go.
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Give a little bit, she took it all.
I said step it up and go-Yeah, man.
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.
Me an' my baby walkin' down the street,
Tellin' everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go.
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Ain't no lovin' since she been gone.
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go.
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more,
Hear my gal call me and I got to go.
Step it up and go-Yeah, man.
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go.

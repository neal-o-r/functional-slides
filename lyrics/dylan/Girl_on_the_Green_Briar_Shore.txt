Twas in the year of eighty-two
In the springtime of the year
I left my mother and a home so dear
All for that girl on the green briar shore.
My mother she says, "Son, don't go
Don't leave me home alone
Don't leave your mother and a home so dear
Never trust a girl on the green briar shore."
But I was young and reckless too
And I craved a reckless life.
I left my mother and a home so dear
And I took that girl to be my wife.
Her hair was dark and curly too
And her lovin' eyes were blue
Her cheeks were like the red red rose
That girl I loved from the green briar shore.
The years rolled on and the months rolled by
She left me all alone.
Now I remember what my mama said,
"Never trust a girl on the green briar shore."

You mistreat me, baby, I can't see no reason why
                                        *)
You know that I'd kill for you, and I'm not afraid to die
You treat me like a stepchild
Oh, Lordy, like a stepchild
I wanna turn my back and run away from you
but oh, I just can't leave you babe
I get nervous in your company, my knees get weak
both my eyes get misty and my tongue can't speak
You treat me like a stepchild
Oh, Lordy, like a stepchild
I wanna turn my back and run away from you
But you know I can't leave you babe.
Ah, you know that I <gotta> love you honey, like a nervous wreck
this way its gonna be like you hold me like a ... around your neck
You treat me like a stepchild
Oh, Lord, like a stepchild
I wanna turn my back and run away from you
But you know I can't let you be
(stepchild)
You treat me like a stepchild
Oh lordy, like a stepchild
I wanna turn and run away from you,
but you know I just can't let you be
You treat me mean, baby <let me> turn around and you treat me rough
I give you all my loving but it doesn't seem to be quite enough
You treat me like a stepchild
Oh, Lord, like a stepchild
I wanna turn and walk all over you
but my heart says: “No, you better let her be”.
Well, I've had the worst and I've had the best
you sure is different, baby, you ain't like all the rest,
but you treat me like a stepchild,
Oh, Lord, like a stepchild
I wanna turn and walk all over you
but my heart says: “No, you better let her be”.
<Was a  man there with you baby, had to have no point of view (??)>
I pulled you out of <dope> scenes, orgies and jam sessions too
but you treat me like a stepchild,
Oh, Lord, like a stepchild
I wanna turn and walk all over you
but my heart says: “Wait a minute now, just let her be”.
You treat me mean girl, and you treat me rough
I give you all my loving, and it's never quite enough
You treat me like a stepchild
Oh, Lordy, like a stepchild
I wanna turn and run all over you
but my heart says: “No, just let it be!”
What's ... what you want me to do
I pull you out of dope scenes, orgies and jam sessions too
You treat me like a stepchild
Oh, Lordy, like a stepchild
I wanna turn and run all over you
but my heart says: “No, just let it be!”
I'll crawl across the desert for you, girl, and the sea so wide
I'll bring you the diamonds from the mine and I'll find you ...
You treat me like a stepchild
Oh, Lord, like a stepchild
I wanna turn and run all over you
but my heart says: “No, just let it be!”

I've just reached a place
Where the willow don't bend.
There's not much more to be said
It's the top of the end.
I'm closin' the book
On the pages and the text
What happens next.
I'm just going,
I been hangin' on threads,
I been playin' it straight,
Now, I've just got to cut loose
Before it gets late.
I been walkin' the road,
I been livin' on the edge,
Before I get to the ledge.
I'm just going,
I've just reached a place
Where the willow don't bend.
There's no more to be said
It's the top of the end.
I've been right on the edge
playing it cool
Before I break the rules (?)
I've been leaning on you
for just too long
and it's not (good?) for you
it's not making me strong, so...
I'm in love with you baby
but you got to understand
that you got to be free
so let go of my hand
I've just reached a place
Where the willow don't bend.
There's not much more to be said
It's the top of the end.
I'm in love with you baby
but you got to understand
that you want to be free,
so let go of my hand
I've been sleeping on the road
with my head in the dust
before it's all diamonds and rust
I've just reached a place
before I can hardly see
so (...) take it what you see
I've been telling you baby
and you got to understand
that you want to be free
so let go of my hand
Well, I've just reached a place
where I can't stay awake
I got to leave you baby
before my heart will break
Come over here baby
'cause I'm telling you this
You gotta believe it
you gotta give me one more kiss
Fix me one more drink baby
and hold me one more time
But don't get too close
To make me change my mind
[instr. verse]
is a two day ride
'cause I'm so dissatisfied
I've just reached a place
where I'm feeling kind of low
I don't mind leaving
And you know I'm not afraid to go
Fix me one more drink baby
and hold me one more time
But don't get too close
and try and make me change my mind
I've been hanging round your house so long
You been treating me like a clown
You don't know how to do nothing,
'cept tear a good man's reputation down
Come over here one more time, baby,
you might shake my hand
I could find me another woman
and you could find you another man
I've just reached a place
where I'm feeling kind of low
I don't mind leaving you
And you know I'm not afraid to go
Fix me one more drink baby
and hold me one more time
But don't get too close
and try and make me change my mind
I've been hanging round your house so long
You been treating me like a clown
You haven't done nothing but
tear a good man's reputation down
Come over here one more time, mama,
and shake my hand
I'm gonna go back to my woman
You can go back to your man
Come over here quickly one time baby
and shake my had
I could find me another woman
you could find you another man

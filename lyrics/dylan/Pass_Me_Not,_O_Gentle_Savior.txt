Hear my humble cry
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by
Place me at Thy throne of mercy
Find my sweet relief.
While I kneel in deep contrition
Help my unbelief
[instr. verse]
Trusting only in Thy merit,
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me,

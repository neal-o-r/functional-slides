Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room, and he called for a glass of beer,
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doin' here?"
"Waitin' for a train, please bring my woman home.
Got three little children and a-weepin', lovin' wife.
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife.
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Sent for the doctor, well the doctor he did come,
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack,
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Hawlin Alley, thought I heard the bulldogs bark-
It must have been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep.
High police catched Stack-A-Lee, and he jumped forty feet.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
Well they got old Stack-A-Lee and they laid him right back in jail.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A-Lee's bail.
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said,"Jailer, I can't sleep.
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons began to creep."

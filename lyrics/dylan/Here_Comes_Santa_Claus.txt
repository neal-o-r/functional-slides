Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pullin' on the reins
Bells are ringin', children singin'
All is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
[He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again]
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
Oh what a beautiful sight
So jump in bed, and cover your head
[He doesn’t care if you’re rich of poor]
for he loves you just the same
[Santa knows that we’re God’s children]
and that makes everything right
[Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer]
cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
He'll come around when the chimes ring out,
when it's Christmas morn again.
[Peace on earth will come to all
If we just follow the light]
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
[Half tempo:] [Peace on earth will come to all]
If we just follow the light
[Let's give thanks to the Lord above]
[Regular tempo:] 'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
['Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.]
[Half tempo:] Let's give thanks to the Lord above
tonight
tonight.

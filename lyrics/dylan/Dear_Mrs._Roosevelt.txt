Dear Mrs Roosevelt, don't hang your head and cry.
His mortal flesh*) is laid away, but his good work fills the sky.
This world was lucky to see him born.
[He's born in a money family on that Hudson's rocky shore.
Outrun every kid a-growin' up 'round Hyde Park just for fun.
This world was lucky to see him born.]
Now he went up to the grade school and he wrote back to his folks.
He drew such funny pictures and was always pulling jokes.
This world was lucky to see him born.
He went on up towards Harvard, to read his books of law.
He loved his trees and horses, he loved everything he saw.
This world was lucky to see him born.
He got struck down by the fever and it settled in his leg.
He loved the folks that wished him well, and everybody did.
This world was lucky to see him born.
He took office on a crippled leg, he said to one and all:
"You money changin' racket boys sure 'nuff got to fall."
This world was lucky to see him born.
[In senate walls and congress halls he used his gift of tongue
To get you thieves and liars told and put you on the run.
This world was lucky to see him born.]
I know this world was lucky just to see him born.
I know this world was lucky just to see him born.
This world was lucky to see him born.

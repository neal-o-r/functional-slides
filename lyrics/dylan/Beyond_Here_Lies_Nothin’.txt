Oh well, I love you pretty baby.
You're the only love I've ever known.
Just as long as you stay with me,
The whole world is my throne.
Beyond here lies nothin',
Nothin' we can call our own.
Well, I'm movin' after midnight.
Down boulevards of broken cars.
Don't know what I'd do without it,
Without this love that we call ours.
Beyond here lies nothin',
Nothin' but the moon and the stars
Down every street there's a window,
And every window's made of glass.
We'll keep on lovin', pretty baby,
For as long as love will last.
Beyond here lies nothin'
but the mountains of the past
jWell my ship is in the harbor,
And the sails are spread.
Listen to me pretty baby,
Lay your hand upon my head.
Beyond here lies nothin',
Nothin’ done and nothin’ said.

You walk into the room
/g#
With your pencil in your hand
/g
You see somebody naked
       /f#
And you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
You raise up your head *)
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
And you say, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel
To be such a freak?"
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers **) you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
You're very well read
It's well known
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels ***)
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Now you see this one-eyed midget
And you say, "For what reason?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back, "You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home"
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is ****)
Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones *****)
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
what you're gonna say
When you get home
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard
But you don't understand
just what you're gonna say
When you get home
 something is happening
But you don't know what it is
You sneak in through the window
And you say, "Is this where it is?"
somebody points his finger at you and says
And you say, "What's mine?"
someone else says, "Where what is?"
Something is happening
But you don't know what it is
You hand in your ticket

Who walks up to ya
When he hears you speak

As he hands you a bone
something is happening

He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice

And says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"
something is happening

You crawl into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And you put your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You gotta be made
To be wearing a telephone
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is

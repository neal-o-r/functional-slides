Silent weekend,
My baby she gave it to me
Silent weekend,
My baby she gave it to me.
She's opened every heart
but at sleep [...] and be part (??)
and she's leavin' me down in misery.
Silent weekend,
My baby she took me by the heart.
Silent weekend,
My baby she took me by the heart.
She's [awake and] bad, she's boastin'
but I know I know she's ghostin'
An' she's tearin' me all apart.
Silent weekend,
Silent weekend,
She's [open] and she's leavin',
but I hate to sit here grievin'
but I just can't sit here playin' dumb.
Silent weekend,
Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain.
Silent weekend,
Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain.
She knows when I'm just teasin'
But it's not likely in the season
To open up a passenger train.

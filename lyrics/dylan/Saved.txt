I was blinded by the devil,
Born already ruined,
Stone-cold dead
As I stepped out of the womb.
He bought me with a price,
Freed me from the pit,
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it.
Nobody to rescue me,
Nobody would dare,
I was going down for the last time,
Not by works,
But by faith in Him who called,
For so long I've been hindered,
For so long I've been stalled.

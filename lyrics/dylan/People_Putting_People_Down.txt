People that are sad, sometimes they wear a frown
People that are kings, sometimes they wear a crown
But the people that don't fit
Get the only fun they get
[from] People putting people down
People putting people down
You may lose your life, you may lose your family
You may lose your mind, just to keep your sanity
But the people that don't fit,
the only fun they get:
People puttin' people down
People putting people down
[Instr. verse]
People that are glad, sometimes they wear a smile
People without dreams will walk an extra mile
But the people that don't fit,
the only fun they get:
People puttin' people down
People puttin' people down
People without love, sometimes build a fence around
The garden up above that makes the whole world go 'round
But all the people that don't fit
Get the only fun they get
From people puttin' people down
People puttin' people down.

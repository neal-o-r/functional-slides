Was in the summer,
One early fall,
Just tryin' to find my
Little all and all
Now she's gone,
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
Was in the spring,
One summer's day.
Just when she left me,
She gone to stay.
Now she's gone.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
Now don't come runnin'
Holdin' up your hand.
Can get me a woman
Quick as you can get a man.
Now she's gone.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
Happen for days,
Didn't know your name.
Or crave you in vain?
Now she's gone.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
Went to the station,
Down in the yard,
Gonna get me a freight train,
Work's done got hard.
Now she's gone.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
The lonesome days,
They have gone by,
You said good-bye.
Now she's gone.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

Night after night you wander the streets of my mind
Night after night, don't know what you think you will find
No place to go, nowhere to turn
Everything around you seems to burn, burn, burn
And there's never any mercy in sight,
Night after Night some nuke plant will blow up the world
Night after night another old man is in some young girl
You look for salvation, you find none
just another broken heart, another barrel of a gun
Just another stick of dynamite
Night after Night you drop dead in your bed
Night after Night another bottle finds a head
Night after Night I think about cuttin' you loose
but I just can't do it - what would be the use?
So I'll just keep on holding you tight,

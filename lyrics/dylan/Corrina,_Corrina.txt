Gal, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina, Gal, where you been so long?
I been worr'in' 'bout you, baby,
Baby, please come home.
I got a bird that whistles,
I got a bird that sings.
I got a bird that whistles,
I got a bird that sings.
Life don't mean a thing.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Gal, you're on my mind.
I'm a-thinkin' 'bout you, baby,
I just can't keep from crying.

You got your body in the way.
You're so damn nonchalant
But it's your mind that I want.
You got me huffin' and a-puffin',
Next to you I feel like nothin',
How'd you ever get that way?
When do you ever see the light?
Don't you ever feel a fright?
You got me burnin' and I'm turnin'
Laying in a stack of hay,
Do you remember where you been?
What's that crazy place you're in?
I'm gonna have to go to college
'Cause you are the book of knowledge,

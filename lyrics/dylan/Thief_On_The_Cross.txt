Well everybody's been diverted,
Everybody lookin' the other way
 Everybody's attention is divided
Well they may not afford to wait, well -
Wanna ask him 'bout his mother
Wanna ask him 'bout his world
Wanna ask him 'bout to talk to himself
If this time it didn't roll too well, well -
Well, everybody know too excited [?]
Don't be too surprised
Head for the dawn and you can see it well
And it's rising in his eyes, well -
Now there's winning, ruling and readin'
Everybody goes [...]
[every scene be] too excited

Lost John's sittin' on a railroad track
Something's out of whack
Blues this mornin' fallin' down like hail
Gonna leave a greasy trailGonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
Then come back and see you.
All I ever do is struggle and strive.
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive.I'm the oldest son of a crazy man,
I'm in a cowboy band
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other sideWell, the world of research has gone berserk
Too much paperwork
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tellI'm goin' where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog
Get away from these demagogues
And these bad-luck women stick like glue
It's either one or the other or neither of the twoShe say, "Look out, daddy, don't want you to tear your pants
You could get wrecked in this dance."
They say whisky'll kill you, but I don't think it will
I'm ridin' with you to the top of the hillDon't know why my baby never looked so good before
Don't have to wonder no more
She been cooking all day, gonna take me all night
I can't eat all that stuff in a single biteThe judge is coming in, everybody rise
Lift up your eyes
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice
'Fore you call me any dirty names, you better think twiceGettin' light outside, the temperature dropped
I think the rain has stopped
I'm gonna make you come to grips with fate
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straightThe bright spark of the steady lights
Has dimmed my sights
When you're around me all my grief gives way
A life time with you is like some heavenly dayEverything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong
I'll be drifting along
The woman I'm a-lovin', she rules my heart
No knife could ever cut our love apart.Today I'll stand in faith and raise
The voice of praise
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light
I wish to God that it were night

and see everybody lose?
Walk around and sing the blues,
Well, darling, I refuse.
Love is hard to find
Love of any kind
And love like yours and mine
Creates its own design.
and see everybody lose?
Walk around and sing the blues,
then I think of you,
The love is not the same,
but either love is true.
see everybody lose
Walk around and sing the blues,
Well, darling, I refuse.

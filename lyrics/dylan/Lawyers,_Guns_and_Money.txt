Well, I went home with the waitress
She was with the Russians, too
I took a little risk
Send lawyers, guns and money
Dad, get me out of this
I'm the innocent bystander
Between the rock and the hard place
        [riff x2]
    [riff x1]
I'm down on my luck
I'm a desperate man
Send lawyers, guns and money
The shit has hit the fan
Send lawyers, guns and money...

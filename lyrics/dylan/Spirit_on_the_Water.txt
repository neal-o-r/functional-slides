Spirit on the water
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking 'bout you, baby,
 And I can't hardly sleep.
I'm travelling by land
Travelling through the dawn of the day
You're always on my mind
I can't stay away
When you're near,
It's just as plain as it can be
I'm wild about you, gal
You ought to be a fool about me
